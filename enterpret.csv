-Typeform
-Salesforce (reps ask customers how happy they are)
-Intercom (he wasn’t initially thinking of this as a feedback source but is interested in seeing what we can surface from support data)

Volume 
-15k to 30k survey responses annually (would like ballpark pricing)

-Capturing feedback in an unstructured way through multiple places
-Using typeform but response rate is lower than he would like
-Want to increase the amount of customer feedback that we generate, bring all the feedback that we recieve on a unified measurement system and bring into a tool that allows to uncover the biggest satisfaction drivers

What decisions are you trying to make?
-want to understand at a large scale what drives satisfaction in our users
-want to leverage feedback more implicitly (for context, heyjobs is a job matching marketplace that matches employers with talent in their platform, but another part of their offering is that employers provide hey jobs with a marketing budget that they distribute across various channels to attract talent, so they want to feedback inform the logic behind how they marketing budget is distributed)


What’s the biggest challenge?
-Not actionable, feedback is silod, want to get a common ground
-feedback isn’t being used at all


-They’re sending surveys that ask customers to rank their satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5, then provide an reason why those that score in an open-text field - wants to use Enterpret to create a report where he can see the reasons provided for each score

-one of the problems they’re having with typeform is that it only captures full responses, so if you don’t complete the form, you lose the whole response, so they’re looking at a tool that does both surveying as well as an analysis of the open-text data

1/18- Decent call with Fabius. Have about 15k survey responses a year, which is the V1 use case for them.

Some things that concern me:
Partnering with the CMO on this - no budget yet exists. They will be the exectuive sponsor.

Mentioned a few other solutions they're looking at today: Lumoa, InMoment, 

Talked about ease of use being a key use case. Point blank said ""this may be a bit too advanced for what we need today""

I asked if depth of insights is even something important to them right now. He said not necessarily, but they will need to get there one day. 

Vocalized high level pricing, going to have a few other vendor chats this week, then connect next week to see what makes sense as the next steps from here.

Still figuring out what survey solution will be best, wants a solution that can do surveys as well.

Wants to decide on a solution in the next 2-4 weeks. Then summary, share with CMO, and make a decision.

1/29- Met with Fabius. Said they have already eliminated another vendor, and it is now just us and InMoment. Final thing is they would like to test this on their survey data.

Pushed on this a bit, tried to steer towards intercom. Send surveys via intercom today that are hosted on Sprig, but the tickets are not a core use case for the sake of this proof of concept. Really wants to see how we work on their open text feedback.

Asked about how his surveys are constructed today, and will get examples before we discuss a PoV.

Fabius is going to be OOO for a MONTH after Friday. Team gets a sabbatical every three years... must be nice :) 

Asked for a ""dummy contract"" and info around GDPR to which I sent security and privacy docs. 

Connecting Wednesday to go through pricing more in-depth, and plan for next steps when he gets back from Indonesia.

1/31- Showed pricing, went through core use cases. Going to connect when he gets back from sabbatical 3/14. Already have some executive alignment which is positive.",<p>No budget this year.</p>,2024-04-09T18:05:52.000+0000,2024-03-27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-She is focusing on automating processes they’re doing manually today
-There are 3 PMs on her team who review insights in Productboard and its very manual
-Also, the person ingesting feedback isn’t the person who needs to do the deeper discovery on that feedback (basically discussing the gap between people who receive feedback directly from customers vs the actual product team who needs insights about this feedback)
-We were trying understand trends and optimizing experience, but volume has gotten too high and has created a gap in our understanding
-Primarily getting feedback through Intercom and Chorus, some surveys and emails

What decisions are you trying to make?
-OKR Framework to identify and justify what we’re gonna focus on our goals for the quarter
-For ex: might want to understand Product market fit for a new module they introduced - will need to see the feedback about that module, or maybe if its a feature that gets a lot of usage, they want to see what the feedback is their to identify the main issues, 
-Want to allow PMs to easily search through feedback easily and find the data that’s going to support what they’re looking into
And also identify where we can go for application polishing and forecasting

What’s the biggest challenge?
-Searchability in PB is really lacking
-Lots of manual association between linking feedback to the actual customer and health of the customer

-They have different add-on modules, planning, coopywriting, video etc, 
-This quarter we’re on some big initiatives across the planning module to release significant new screens
-When we release that, we want to see how the feedback is being received - we have some visibility through Mixpanel

-Volume is unclear, a few hundred make it into Productboard every month, but definitely not every ticket is sent to PB, unclear on total # support tickets,

1/18- Had a solid chat with Shanna. Feedback was positive from the product team, but ""the proof will be in the pudding"". 

The key thing here is she cares about depth of insights, and the PM team seems techincal. Key takeaway is eliminating the manual labor being 1.A, and feeling more confident in validating their hypothesis. 

Budget wise, there is budget to be had if we are able to check the boxes for her organization. Will continue to dig into this on 1/26. In the meantime, I've sent her and the team access to the Zoom playground instance, and will start adding sources soon.

Wants to add:
Intercom 
Chorus recordings...
Mixpanel may also make sense...

Manual process- KEY driver. Intercom full stop. 
Seeing feedback on new modules, releases etc would also be a key use case.
Proactive reporting of new modules. Sharing feedback on this internally.
""What are you going into product board for today?""

For V1, this is the use case. Talking a lot about journey from v1-v2-v3. 

Starting to analyze calls on chatGPT

3/5- Met with Shanna- this is going to be a tough deal to get over the finish line. Concerns about manual effort of the taxonomy primarily or the ""formatting errors"" so to speak, and getting it to a usable place.

Going to connect her with Osmind to see what she thinks after talking directly to an existing customer who has gone through a migration from productboard.

She's been incredibly thoughtful for a 12k deal, but appreciate her thoughtfulness. 

This is truly 50/50, connecting next week to see where things sit.","<p>Taking into consideration current state Enterpret functionality, change management / operational processes, and cost as it compares to Productboard, Enterpret is not currently something we can move forward with at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>Your product has a lot of potential and I am excited to see how it continues to develop in the future, but unfortunately it is not the right fit for our operation at this moment in time.</p>",2024-02-22T16:13:57.000+0000,2024-03-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon being filtered down on the dashboard, the % calculation is still based off the total number of unfiltered records as opposed to the total number of filtered records. The only way I can get it to properly calculate a filtered percentage was after I toggled “Measure as” from % to # to % again.

User: I’ll take this opportunity to also plead my case for one or both of the following:
• adding the count (#) to at least the tooltip when hovering over a bar on a % chart (especially in the dashboard view)
• Adding the ability to toggle between # and % in the ( ⠇) chart menu, similar to “Switch to Table View”
It can be much easier to parse/summarize results when looking at relative %’s (esp when comparing filtered results). However, it can be dangerous because of the law of small numbers, as the sample size for each percentage breakdown is not available at a glance.

Agent: &gt; The only way I can get it to properly calculate a filtered percentage was after I toggled “Measure as” from % to # to % again.
Glad this makes it work, this also validates that this is a bug - raising with eng

Good usability suggestions, also passing along to our eng team

User: Jack Divita It doesn’t actually make it work. It’s still broken on the dashboard. E.g. I removed a filter and the % didn’t update on the chart which I toggled and updated

User: Jack Divita looks like the reason it didn’t update is because going into the chart, making an update to it, and coming back to the dashboard a couple times resulted in dashboard filters that were applied when clicking through to the individual chart ended up saving at the chart level (as opposed to being treated as an ephemeral filter)

Agent: Interesting - that doesn't look right either. Let me chat with the team tonight and get back to you on this

User: We synced orders/revenue via census into the users object, wanted to confirm that is correct, and try to get some context about the accounts object (what is it, when would we sync data there instead, etc)

Agent: Jeffrey Mullahey Are the email addresses available and visible when you view the survey responses in Delighted? E.g., this one:
<<STRICT_LINK>>

Agent: The account object is meant for B2B companies, so probably won't be relevant for Boll & Branch. E.g., a tech company sells its software to the *account* Acme Corporation and there are several *users* including R. Runner and W. E. Coyote.

User: Matt Miller an email address is visible to me when I view the delighted survey response

User: Matt Miller instead of accounts, we want to link users in Delighted to native users in your app via email (as we currently do with Zendesk)

Agent: Every record (feedback, user, or account) in Enterpret needs a unique identifier. In this case, we are asking for an id that can tell us whether a row is new or existing. This id can be anything – e.g., if you were using an export of data from Salesforce, you might use ContactId as the identifier for users.

User: sorry not totally following -- the instructions in census for selecting a sync key say that the column and field should have the same unique value -- so I was assuming somewhere in enterpret there is an ID field created for each record that is defined as their email

Agent: You're correct – when the sync ran for the first time and these rows were added to the User table in Enterpret, each one had its Id field populated with the user email

User: might be worth discussing live - it seems that for census to sync a record to enterpret there has to be a match on our source email and enterpret Id, and I'm not familiar with what the enterpret ID is or how it's defined (it obviously matches our source email or no records would sync)

User: sorry I think I get it now -- my first sync was an update or create -- so those emails didn't map to any id's but they were created during the first sync

User: Matt Miller we now have our census sync set to update only, because we only want to send data for customers that have feedback in enterpret, but if a new customer feedback is added, I'm assuming we won't have the enterpret user ID available for syncing via census, does that make sense?

Agent: I'm not sure I follow. Want to connect quickly to discuss?

User: yep that'd be great

","The user is seeking clarification on the 'Id' field in Enterpret, which is required for syncing via census. The agent explains that this field is a unique identifier for each record and is initially populated with the user's email during the first sync. The user expresses concern about the sync process for new customer feedback and the agent suggests a quick call to discuss this further.",enterpret-boll-and-branch,https://enterpret.slack.com/archives/C04GWNR5THP/p1704738632142189?thread_ts=1704738632.142189&cid=C04GWNR5THP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

User: I’m also seeing some weird filters or I’m not sure what’s going on. I haven’t even changed the dates yet to be for December, but this is what I’m seeing that’s messing with the data. Why does it say `Success - Category` and `CLM - Category`?

Agent: Emily Nicklas I turned the dashboard into a template, now if you click on the ""+New Dashboard"" button you will see this option. If you create a new dashboard with this template you will have full control and edit access to the charts

Agent: &gt; but this is what I’m seeing that’s messing with the data. Why does it say `Success - Category` and `CLM - Category`?
This is because this is the technical name of the field coming from Zendesk

User: Thank you for the instructions on creating a new dashboard.
Re: the other thing, I’m confused, because the field name isn’t matching what the Quantify is about `CLM - Category` is showing as the field, but the Quantify is about `Clickwrap Category`, how did that happen?
And the data is different from when I pulled the Nov data in December. I know that there are usually a few tickets that get updated, but when I pull the exact same things I pulled last month, with the same exact filters, I get wildly different results.
For example, I pulled `CLM Top 5 Categories` with Case Reason = Technical Issues for Nov 1-30. Last month’s was screenshot #1, when I pull the same today, I get screenshot #2. And if I change the field from `Success - Category` to `CLM - Category`, it’s even more off (screenshot #3).
Happy to set up a call to go over these if we need to.

Agent: Emily Nicklas this should not be happening, I suspect that there are mismatching filters at play

Is it possible to get Enterpret data ingested into SnowFlake? Here is some context on our requirement:
• We've been using Enterpret to investigate some complex bugs where we can only rely on CS tickets to quantify the issue. 
• There are many tricky cases where we are missing the user ID on zen desk, so we only have the customer's email to work with. 
• In that case, we copy the email from the ticket data on Enterpret and look it up on SF to get the User IDs. 
Let me know if there is a better way, open to any suggestions. Thank you:)

User: Quick intros<IP>Marshall Kurtz, e-meet Jack Divita. Jack, e-meet Marshall.
Marshall is our head of solutions engineering &amp; has worked a lot of the customer feedback catalogue that lives in Notion.
Jack is our Enterpret CSM; we now have Gong calls in Enterpret so I wanted to make sure that Marshall is aware and has access (already sent him instructions to get access if he doesn't have it yet) since it's such a great tool to understand volumes and themes of the asks we get from our users.
Marshall Kurtz, Jack is a great resource if you have any questions (I'm also happy to help whenever I can) - feel free to ping him directly, in this channel, and/or join our weekly calls on Wednesdays (10:30 PT, 1:30 ET). We also have some trainings already recorded which you can find <<STRICT_LINK>>

Agent: Hey Marshall Kurtz nice to be connected with you!
Like Kayla mentioned, we have integrated all of your Gong calls into Enterpret which means you will be able to analyze common questions and trends seen in the sales calls by stage/customer/type/etc.
I'd love to show you what we have been working on and see how we might be able to help you with some of your day-to-day reporting. Here is an example dashboard highlighting feedback from these sales calls: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Would you be open to meeting for an intro call sometime next week?

Agent: Kayla Eliaza who would be the right person to highlight these trends to?

User: I'm guessing that Alan Doyle is already aware of the spike since I think he was the one to log it, but he's currently the best person re: incidents

Agent: Hi Alan Doyle wanted to make sure these trends above were on your radar, and that you can use Enterpret to help root cause and understand who was most impacted by the issue. Attaching a screenshot showing the distribution of users impacted by the Saving issue - is there other information that would be helpful to include in this report?
Additionally - this dashboard shows us that there were 4X as many tickets with the contact reason `User Issues<IP>🟡 Notion Incident` last week as is typically expected - here is an auto generated summary of those tickets. Hope that helps!

Here is a more detailed launch readiness checklist that you all can use in order to make sure you are prepared to understand your customer feedback around new launches, this is an expansion on what we talked through yesterday: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Here is the dashboard of inbox 2.0 insights we created together yesterday: <<STRICT_LINK>>
You can quickly filter feedback to the inbox 2.0 topic by using the custom filter (see attached screenshot)

The plan is to rely less on routing feature request to discourse and handle them through AI-support chatbot as well as agent supported tickets. So in the future, we'd rely on zendesk and forethought for all of our feature requests received by support. cc: Chaitanya Hari and Marc Cruz who are starting to think about this on the support side.

User: cc Omar Guerrero

Agent: Its on the roadmap, though no timeline planned at this point. We have analyzed conversations handled by Forethought for quite a few of our other customers though
Interestingly, I have seen some inconsistency in the implementations. Do all of your Forethought conversations get sent to Zendesk or only the ones that get handed off to a human agent?

Agent: Additionally, in Figma's case specifically, which of these sets of tickets make their way into Snowflake?

User: only the forethought convos that get handed off to a human get sent to zendesk, interested in getting all forethought conversations into enterpret for analysis though

Agent: We need to figure out how to get that data out of Forethought then. Historically we have analyzed this data through a CSV extract that their reps have shared with us.
I will re-start the convo on our side, do you know if they are offering an API that would allow you to get all of your conversations into your instance of Snowflake?

User: they offer this as an out of the box integration, i'll ask them about what APIs they have available. We don't yet have forethought hooked up to anything

Agent: I suspect that will be the best route for us, given that you are sending us all of your Zendesk tickets through Snowflake and not from Zendesk directly

","The conversation discusses the integration of a new AI support tool, Forethought, into Enterpret Inc's system. The agent and user explore the possibility of sending all Forethought conversations to Zendesk for analysis and consider the use of APIs and out-of-the-box integrations.

 ◦ Enterpret chat interface (called `Wisdom` ) should be exiting our closed alpha testing soon and entering a generally available beta by end of month. This chat interface should make the product a lot easier to use for brand new users - combined with our planned taxonomy updates there should be a significant improvement to usability (see attached screenshot for example)

Agent: Hey Elliya - something like <<STRICT_LINK>> would work [essentially searching by the ID].
For tags, I think [Jack Divita can correct me here], Notion is not on mutable records, i.e., a notion zendesk ticket is only ingested once in Enterpret, normally after a short delay. Some tags are applied after ticket resolution, which is why searching on them wouldn't be reliable.

User: Ah, perfect! Thanks Arnav, that's exactly what I was looking for.

Agent: curious that the contact reason and date didnt work, was that just because it returned too many matches?

User: Nope, the ticket hasn't been closed yet! So either it isn't in enterpret yet, or the tags haven't been applied, or...
Searching by the unique ID returned no results for that unique ID either. Not urgent, I'll check it in a few days.

Can the field values be fixed to have timestamp and re-synced? I’ve turned on mutability on our end, so we would ingest the updated feedbacks.

Also i needed to do a custom sql query for the message_sent_time = create_time :

Agent: Duncan Stewart
• *Keywords:* In our current approach, we only do initial keyword tagging from user text, though we will subsequently highlight relevant terms in agent text. Since these are all internal messages, they are being considered as agent text. However, we are releasing an update to our keyword logic in a couple of weeks that should fix this.
• *Reasons:* It's not clear why reasons didn't get tagged here. There is one record that does have a few, and most of the rest have large numbers of suggested reasons, so it looks like the confidence just ended up being low in most of the cases. I am checking with the team to make sure nothing else is going on, though.

Agent: ^ this is a good first draft - but since weve got a lot of time we can spend some time digging in and highlighting trends over time and specific quarters etc.
take a first look and let me know your thoughts - we can make it better tomorrow

User: amazing! thanks jack! we'll take a look and share our feedback

User: hey Jack Divita if we want to ingest more chats into enterpret, what would you need? is it just the chat id and transcript?

Agent: Almost, all we ""need"" is
• chat ID
• transcript
• date of conversation
Other metadata on who the user is is always useful. But what is typically most useful, is being able to do analysis that shows:
1. These are the tickets that the chatbot is good at solving on its own
2. These are the tickets that the chatbot had to pass along to a human
3. These are the tickets that only went to a human
it is not exactly clear to me how we separate the tickets into these buckets, is it safe to assume all of the tickets in 1) are the ones from the CSV? how do we know which ones are in 2)?

User: thanks! do you happen to know what the last chat date we previously uploaded? i'm also considering just taking feb onward. we turned off the buttons so this data would probably give us better info on what customers are asking
1. we don't have a good way for checking this now. the CSV will include all chats including escalated to a human
2. if the chat escalated to an agent, we'll have a ticket ID that i can add to it. however, a ticket is also created if the customer goes through the feature request, language intent, or the customer indicates at the end the bot resolved their issue. 
 a. there's also a deflect tag but this would also include dropoffs which could account for a majority of the chats

Agent: &gt; do you happen to know what the last chat date we previously uploaded? i'm also considering just taking feb onward
we have through January end, so that makes sense

User: i'm working with Forethought to get the export. i'll share it over once i get it

User: Jack Divita here are the CSVs for feb-today

","The user requests an analysis of customer queries handled by the chatbot, and discusses the process of uploading more recent chat data for analysis.

CC Shelley Lee

Agent: I think all would be useful because we have all types already coming in from Gong
Basically, this is what we want to do. Right now for all the Gong calls coming in we have the opportunity stage - at the time of the call. Some of these calls go on to be won opportunity and some go on to be lost, but we currently do not have the data to know which is which.
When you share the list of closed-lost opportunities we will update the Gong records so you will be able to see the stage at the time of the call, as well as the eventual/final stage of the opportunity. This will allow us to show you the differences in trends between opportunities that were won vs. lost

User: Sure - please see attached. I have excluded anything that was a true-up (type = expansion) as these are essentially billing events and not true deals. This will include our new biz lands, renewals, and add-ons.

Agent: Shelley Lee any chance you could export these with the 18 digit case safe ID instead of the 15 digit one?

Agent: :thankyou:

","The user and agent discuss the details needed for a win/loss csv file. The agent explains the importance of having data on both won and lost opportunities.

Anyone at Notion can have access to Enterpret - we do not charge by the license and there is no limit to the number of licenses.
But, they would need a user in order to access the dashboard. Were they getting an error when trying to sign up?

Agent: oh - I forgot we configured SSO to be required to login
Jeremy Bui Kayla Eliaza can you remind me how users get access to Enterpret through SSO?

User: Oh, if they need to be provisioned for Enterpret in our identity provider (we use Okta) and have the ""tile"" in Okta for Enterpret, they'll have to go through IT.

User: yep, that's correct. they just need to submit a request iwth IT and we can approve it

I'm going through and doing the work to merge similar ones, but curious if this will be a Sisyphean task :sweat_smile:

Agent: &gt; Will Enterpret continue creating new reasons, ad infinitum?
Yes, we do refreshes every two weeks in order to capture insights from new product releases and trends from your users
&gt; I'm going through and doing the work to merge similar ones, but curious if this will be a Sisyphean task :sweat_smile:
Nooooooo :sweat_smile: think of it more like weeding your garden than pushing your stone
You are correct in that technically the list will continue to grow over time, but I promise you that merging reasons together is incredibly high leverage to improve the quality of your instance. And we are actively investing in better tooling to learn from the types of merges you make, along with better automated deduplication

User: oh boy, I appreciate the reframe but it sure feels like pushing a stone right now :sweat_smile:

Agent: yeah, thats fair
I would be happy to help and/or hear your feedback on what is time consuming about it today - we want to make this process easier

User: 1. The wait time to see the changes reflected in the dashboard isn't great, since I feel like I still ""see"" the clutter while it processes on the backend. It's helpful that they turn grey!
2. The prediction of which reasons to merge is quite good! The search works well and having both the search and the prediction feels quite effective.
3. There are *so many* reasons that have only been applied to 1 ticket, and which have very subtle name differences. E.g. `Help Inviting Members` vs `Help Inviting Members in Notion` vs `Help Inviting Members in Notion Workspace`. Maybe for some products this would be a helpful distinction, but some concept in the model of ""Everything is going to be part of Notion, or part of a Notion workspace. You do not need to differentiate between these concepts"" could go a long way.
4. Sometimes the customers don't use the same words as we would to describe a feature. We get reasons with their wording, and with our wording. I've merged some of these to use our wording, but I have a feeling that more will keep popping up with the customers wording. Would be great to clearly indicate ""these sorts of conversations are actually all about this concept -- label the reasons accordingly."" Our clearest example is for a feature called `allowed email domains`, which lets users automatically join a Notion workspace as members. In tickets, this mostly shows up as complaints about ""I tried to add <mailto:<EMAIL_ADDRESS>|<EMAIL_ADDRESS>> as a guest, but they popped into being a member! How do I fix it?"" and the reason is called something like `Issue with unexpected guest adding behavior`. When I'm reviewing the dashboard, I need to understand that _our product is behaving properly_ and these are not bug reports. I've relabeled for now to be more like `Help understanding allowed email domain feature` since that's a category that will make more sense for our product teams

Agent: Elliya Cutler - thank you so much for this feedback!
Looping in a couple folks from my team to make sure this doesn't go to waste
Vivek Kaushal is our product manager and is designing our next generation of taxonomy (you should start to see some changes in Q2) - Vivek, let's make sure we are taking in to account Elliya's feedback
Ansup Babu is our machine learning lead working on reason deduplication. Ansup - can we run the new deduplication script on Notions data? I suspect it would be able to catch many of these examples provided by Elliya
Arnav Sharma is our CTO - FYI on some current pain points with managing the taxonomy

User: Running a dedupe script would be incredibly helpful! No rush :slightly_smiling_face: Appreciate you listening.

Agent: if we shared a spreadsheet offline sometime next week where you could go through and confirm/deny our automated suggested merges would that work?

User: sure! I was trusting/frustrated enough to just let you merge them :sweat_smile:

Agreed about adding value for other audio/video sources. I think this could be a nice upgrade, but with Gong still the primary call source customers use, I think we'd need to be convinced that we could deliver something higher in quality and usability than them

Agent: Why does Zachariah Ooi want call brief in Enterpret?

Agent: &gt; Why does Zachariah Ooi want call brief in Enterpret?
Because it's a useful way to catch up on / remember the overall content of the call. Call title can help with that, but if it's a recurring meeting less so

Agent: Mockup (it would probably need a special place on the feedback card)

Agent: another way to think about it - if there is useful data available from the source integration, why wouldnt we want to ingest it?

Agent: What if next feature request is to ingest call outlines, action items etc from Gong?

Agent: then that would imply we have a new persona (sales people) using our product

Agent: What sort of prompts do you see yourself using for `customize summary`? Or is it like a catch all in case `shorten`/`lengthen` don't give the result you are looking for?

",The user expressed a desire to modify and tailor the Enterpret summaries to better suit their needs. They suggested that the summaries sometimes feel too short and that they would like the ability to customize the length and type of the summary. The agent found the idea interesting and proposed the idea of looping in another person to discuss it further. The user also mentioned that they like Coda's UI for this purpose.,enterpret-figma,https://enterpret.slack.com/archives/C03RJBY6Q7N/p1712862656615959?thread_ts=1712862656.615959&cid=C03RJBY6Q7N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. When we do release a feature that customers asked for, we want to be able to close the loop

Definitely seems like Zendesk is most important source, but I also asked if there were specific channels in Discord where they receive feedback, to which they said General and the two help channels

Lack of integration with Attio is not a nonstarter


Zendesk includes categories for each product that they offer, then they have two subcategories (feedback and bugs), that fall under each of these product areas.

This chart is based on the keywords Majestic and Missing Ping. I have since come across some Zendesk ticket IDs such as 532452 and 532436 which have reasons relating to Majestic, but they don't have any keywords attached so they weren't included in the export.
Would it be possible to either get Enterpret to check through any feedback with no keywords and add appropriate ones, or is there an alternative way that I can identify all complaint feedback relating to Majestic to export a list of the ticket IDs?

Agent: Hi Louise Sellars, here's what I think is happening: We tag keywords primarily from the user messages and not from the agent ones. In these examples that you mentioned (<<STRICT_LINK>>, <<STRICT_LINK>>) the entire conversation appears as a transcript within the agent message, and as a result the keyword detection is misfiring. I'm checking with the team to understand why our other inferencing methods (e.g., identifying keywords from reasons/summary) failed here.

Agent: Also relevant: we are releasing an update to keywords this month, and it should help resolve this issue.

Hi Kylie Henson nice to be connected with you :slightly_smiling_face: The context from Kayla is pretty much exactly right. We have quite a few customers where we are helping them analyze their chatbot conversations with things like:
• What are the most frequent questions users are asking the chatbot?
• What are the types of questions the chatbot is able to resolve on its own?
• What are the types of questions that the chatbot regularly needs human intervention on?

Agent: Alan Doyle Kayla Eliaza following up from the other thread since this is currently setup to be a weekly alert
Looks like the trend of outages increasing significantly continued from two weeks ago into last week as well.
I figured it would be helpful to dig in to some of these trends:
• *Issue With Saving In Notion* is 321% higher than expected _(59 Records)._
 ◦ ~60% impacting users on a free plan
 ◦ 30% on team plan
 ◦ only 30% of Zendesk data has device information available
 ▪︎ 65% split on Windows, 35% max
 ◦ Student and personal persona's primarily impacted, &gt;95% of reports in English
• *Issue With Adding Images* is 175% higher than expected _(44 Records)._
 ◦ 75% of reports on from users on Browser vs. the electron app
Is this type of breakdown useful? There is a lot of other metadata we can share the distribution on - any top of mind you would want to see?

","The user has shared a report on the weekly dashboard anomalies, highlighting issues with the Notion app such as error messages, saving problems, and issues with adding images. The agent, in response, provides a detailed breakdown of the issues, including the percentage of impact on different user plans, device information, and user personas. The agent also offers to share more metadata as per the user's requirement.",enterpret-notion,https://enterpret.slack.com/archives/C01P90H8K1S/p1712041413363299?thread_ts=1712041413.363299&cid=C01P90H8K1S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agent: Louise Sellars The messages would be from internal users? We would treat them as internal and wouldn't generate predictions from them. But one approach that another customer came up with is to use Zapier:
• Add a custom emoji to Slack, Enterpret logo called :send-to-enterpret:
• Configure a Zap where any time someone reacts to a Slack message with that emoji it gets sent to Enterpret

User: Thanks Matt, what we're aiming to do is analyse the themes of historical messages sent to a Slack channel where requests to the ops team are handled, to identify the key contact reasons. It doesn't sound like it's currently possible for old messages, we'll have a think about a different approach cc Grant Orchard

User: Do we ask for CSAT multiple times within a ticket’s lifecycle? I thought we only ask it when the ticket is closed.

User: nope, we only ask for the CSAT 24 hours after the ticket is solved (for email). twitter tickets will receive the CSAT every time the ticket is solved but we can adjust as needed

User: Nice! Is what enterpret calls “sentiment” different from CSAT? I thought they were the same 

User: i was looking at the customer sentiment throughout the entire ticket, not their CSAT survey. the thought behind this one is that we'd be able to find tickets tickets where the support team turned the customer's interaction around

User: Right. So what Enterpret calls “sentiment” is different from CSAT?

User: Jack Divita please correct me on this but Enterpret User Sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticket/interaction. ""Satisfaction Rating"" will be the customer's response to the CSAT survey

Agent: &gt; please correct me on this but Enterpret User Sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticket/interaction. ""Satisfaction Rating"" will be the customer's response to the CSAT survey
This is exactly correct

User: thanks Jack Divita! do you know if it would also be possible to track the sentiment change within an interaction?

Agent: currently not possible, but this is not the first time we have heard this request. Have raised it with the engineering team and there will be exploration on the feasibility in the coming weeks

User: thanks! if this gets added to the roadmap, can you let us know? this could be a useful metric for us

Agent: definitely!
Before being added to the roadmap we will likely have some follow up questions on use cases and specific examples. Any additional details/thoughts you can share on those would also be helpful

User: of course, no problem
• positive -&gt; negative:
 ◦ does this lead to churn?
 ◦ are there policies that are causing this change ?
 ◦ these can also be used to identify coaching opportunities
• negative -&gt; positive: 
 ◦ identify tickets where an agent did an good job. can be used to improve training or feedback for the agents

Agent: &gt; • does this lead to churn?
This one is doable today without analyzing intra-ticket sentiment changes, we just need a little more data from Notion

Agent: Meaning - if you tell me which of your users churned (and when) I can tell you what problems they had before churning and how those compared vs users who have not churned
This is a VERY common use case today

User: In order to tell you which users have churned (and when), we'd probably have to pull subscription changes in from Stripe, which is managed by my team. Jack Divita, do you have any additional information about how/what you'd need from us to get churn data into Enterpret? I can ask my engineers if they have time for it.

Agent: The only thing I _need_ is something to join it agains the feedback record. For Zendesk it looks like we have user email, unique user ID, workspace ID, external user ID. For Gong we have workspace ID, user ID, and Email. For forethought, all I have is a record ID
I would also recommend including other additional metadata that might be useful for analysis: sign up date, churn date, churned ARR, number of seats churned, etc.

Mitch Louie shared with me an extract of closed-lost deals over the last 6 months that I uploaded to Enterpret and we can use to look at common requests (and to compare/contrast vs. deals that were won)
Here is a link to the first iteration of the dashboard to help with this. I added some filters to the charts to try and highlight reasons that (to me) seemed actionable: <<STRICT_LINK>>
A couple of highlights that stood out to me:
• The ability to search through contracts comes up in lost deals twice as often as won deals
• Redlining documents comes up 4X as often in lost deals
• Setting reminders for contracts comes up 8X as often in lost deals
• A clause library comes up 6X as often in lost deals
• OCR on contracts seems is also a common one on lost deals
I am imagining this as an iterative process where we can continue to drill in to some of these reasons to make them more specific and further filter the list so it is as useful for you as possible
I'm excited to help start with this process and keep going from here - let me know your thoughts!

Agent: Hi Sy Dusk, unfortunately this isn't possible at the moment. But this has been requested before so I'll definitely convey your suggestion to the product team.

I thought you could already do this?

I can't seem to find this...

Agent: Hey Duncan Stewart you can view Unified Fields on clicking on Profile (SS attached) you can navigate to ""Manage Unified Fields"" section. These are also visible on Search and Quantify.
For Integration Descriptions, you can go to the integrations page and click edit on any integration that you have. You can add descriptions to each integration.

User: Ah, thanks Saurabh Arora!

User: I've added description to all of the integrations. Let me know if any of them could be improved.
Can I expect ""reasons"" to change/improve based on this (i.e. backdated)?

we have a customer feedback catelog which includes feature requests and bugs about different components in Notion. we'd like to use Enterpret to provide product teams with quantifiable insights and verbatim quotes into these to understand what's more important and impactful to our customers

User: Thanks Jeremy and Jack! More details:
• we're specifically looking to examine our tickets that are coming in from Zendesk that are type `bug` or `feature request` -- not interested in `general question, stripe action`, or `admin action`.
• we're also looking to blend our zendesk tickets with gong data, so we can see verbatim customer quotes from both places when looking at a specific contact reason.
• we have a list of ~200 specific descriptions of Notion product areas (a few examples: synced blocks, the ""wiki"" function, database sorting, page deletion...) and we'd love to map that on top of all of the data we have in enterpret. right now, our engineers use those tags to determine if a specific area of the product is becoming buggier than we have a tolerance for

Using the same number makes it look like all data is coming from one single record (which I would be less likely to trust - I don't want to weight any one response by that much). It would be great if each unique record could have a unique citation number. So, here it would be [1], [2], [3], [4] etc. because each link is unique. And if one record is referenced multiple times, re-use that citation number. (Is this actually a bug?)

User: Here's the actual copy-pasted report in slack:
*Confusion Over Developer Mode Access Rights*
Users have reported various *Issue With Development Mode Access* _(6 Records)_ , including mistakenly granting access to the wrong user <<STRICT_LINK>]> being unable to give dev mode access to another user <<STRICT_LINK>]> and their developers losing access to the mode <<STRICT_LINK>]>. Some users' access level was not sufficient for the dev mode feature to work <<STRICT_LINK>]>.

Agent: This is very helpful feedback Molly Jane Nicholas, thank you for sharing!

User: I always thought the citation numbers represented counts of records :thinking_face: 

User: That would be a very non-standard usage of the citation format - if they're meant to represent counts I would strongly ask that they not use the standard citation format which pretty much universally means ""specific link to single resource"". Something like (_x records_) (the way it appears at the top) would work for counts.

User: Molly Jane Nicholas is this how ivy league presidents get fired? lol

User: Just coming back to this - it doesn't seem to mean counts: each number links to only one record. If it represents multiple records, it would need to link to each one.

User: Thanks Molly Jane Nicholas! definitely my oversight.

Agent: &gt; each number links to only one record.
That’s correct Molly Jane Nicholas — just adding some more context on the current behaviour — the numbers start from 1 for each claim in a summary. E.g:
&gt; Users appreciate Figma’s user interface [1][2], and visual design [1]. They also appreciate They also appreciate its robust prototyping tools [1][2][3].
For this sample from a summary, 2 specific records are cited where users have praised the user interface, 1 specific record where users have praised the visual design, and 3 specific records where users have appreciated the prototyping tool.
Thank you again for flagging how this can be confusing! Have shared this feedback with the wider team, we’ll work on making this more intuitive. :raised_hands<IP>skin-tone-4:

-Valerie joined last week
-One of her first projects is to improve the product feedback loop
-Feedback is not reliably making its way to the product team
-In terms of current process for making sure Product team has visibility into actionable insights, they have a complicated process where internal users will submit a ticket which then goes into Notion for CSMs to analyze, then they send it to Product who has has to piece meal it with the right segmentation, ARR, 
-Overall she does not like how much internal bias and analysis is being doing before making its way to product, would rather just have a strong automated analysis of raw feedback, product is still spending too much time analyzing feedback when they should just be making informed decisions

Sources
-Zendesk
-CS and Sales Calls and Emails - Gong and Salesforce
-NPS surveys - can’t remember name of tool but its not an integration we have
 

How do you prioritize/segment feedback?
-Rating, high medium, low of how much they would like to have a particular feature
-Mentioned ARR data plays into prioritization
-Doesn’t think they’re using Census


-Really wants to know how to close the loop in Enterpret
Her job is to make this whole process but she believes her CPO is against the use of any third party tooling to solve this
-Asked for send case studies and might want to try to get CPO on demo call
-Wants to do demo late next week, but is traveling and will need to coordinate over email, tentative invite for Friday in the meantime
-Found out about us cause she saw our Notion Case Study Feedback Loop about a year ago
-Wants something in place by end of April","<p>Thank you for meeting with us this week! The demo was immensely helpful in understanding what use cases Enterpret could solve for us. Unfortunately, Josh and I came to the conclusion that Enterpret is not the right solution for us at the moment. Our focus is mainly on product operations, particularly internal and external communication and prioritization. We were genuinely impressed with the product and will certainly keep you in mind for the future.</p><p><br></p>",,2024-03-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

User: Hey Matt! Thanks for checking in. We are still facing challenges with the admin needed to clean up reasons. A PM sent me a message yesterday about a reason that's still tracking new feedback records even though it's out of date. It's getting to the point where they are becoming turned off from the reports being sent to them because the reasons are off.
As we've talked about before, we don't have the administrative time to clean them up. :disappointed:

Tanner Hopkins Can you share more about this?

User: Yeah, we have a reason associated with customers who want a mobile app. Well, we have a mobile app, but feedback is still getting assigned to it even though we have a mobile app.

Agent: Hi Tanner Hopkins, got it. Here is what is happening – the reason `Ability To Have A Mobile App` has a few different definitions that have wrongly been grouped together. I will clean this up and move the incorrect ones elsewhere. We are actually working on some automated approaches to detect issues like this, since it is emerging as an issue for many customers. cc Arnav Sharma

User: Thanks! Yeah, I know how to clean it up, but thinking more broadly, this is just one example of many reasons that are wrong/out of date that require a lot of time to maintain, as we've talked about before.

User: Hi Seth Harris! What types and how many of social posts are you not seeing captured? Can you provide a few examples so Jack Divita and I can investigate? I don't think there is an elegant way to manually trigger posts to be ingested by Enterpret.

Agent: We do have some ways we might be able to go about this. Seth Harris what is the source of these posts?

User: Hey sorry for the slow response, been heads down on the multi edit launch today.

User: A good example is feedback we saw from the recent prototyping bundle launch:
<<STRICT_LINK>> I just want scroll interactions and cursor effects
<<STRICT_LINK>> Is there a reason why only the Pixel 2 model is offered, but not the Pixel 8? I know you can't cover all Android devices. But... if you already ""support"" Pixel. Why not the lastest models? Would be great if there is the same selection for Frames. :slightly_smiling_face:
<<STRICT_LINK>> ""Gonna need some more Android device options, my dude. Let's get some Pixels in there.
Haha, nice work though!""
<<STRICT_LINK>> Still waiting for z-index for components with variants with floating elements inside autolayout
<<STRICT_LINK>> But when you set the height to 0, smart animate does not work for height animations.
<<STRICT_LINK>> Hope once you will add different timelines for different layers to make sequential transition animations
<<STRICT_LINK>> ""What about adding folders to the pages pane? That seems to be more highly requested than these micro improvements :sweat_smile:
What about setting default assets to projects / teams so I don’t have to add them with every new file?""
<<STRICT_LINK>> Aspect-ratio lock for images is next?
<<STRICT_LINK>> Record mode would be nice addition
<<STRICT_LINK>> Really to much good, but when you will add also screen record feature?
<<STRICT_LINK>> Could you please make this exportable as a PNG?? It’s so frustrating working with mock-up frames from the community sometimes
<<STRICT_LINK>> ""any possible way to have the time, signal, wifi, and battery indicators automatically added when previewing on the device?
provides a more true preview""
<<STRICT_LINK>> Amazing! A quick wish from here: If I would be able to pull the preview out of the app window and onto another screen it would be SICK! Then it would not be interfering with my design (yea sure I can open a new Figma window, but that's not the same! :D).

User: I'm on a mission to make sure that this type of in-the-moment feedback isn't lost and that it is captured somewhere it can be surfaced to product.

On the different between these summaries -- the insight email summaries are powered by a different model today. We’re working on both — improvements to the summarisation model, and on making these summaries consistent across the product and reports.

User: Alex Mullans, yes we migrated to okta sso and you should be able to access it from the okta dashboard.

User: Landon Howa can you please help us troubleshoot?

User: Alex Mullans it might be you need to request in Opal if this is your first time accessing it?

User: if okta is letting you go through, and Enterpret is the one with error, that might be on enterpret side though Jack Divita

User: Hey Alex, what Dev mentioned should work if you can request it please! Can be requested <<STRICT_LINK>>

User: ah ok great, thanks! didn't realize we'd migrated to Okta/Opal. Just requested.

User: One note for the Enterpret folks - I'd expect some sort of ""you're not provisioned for this app"" 403 message, rather than just getting silently kicked back to the login screen when SSO fails.

This is super fair feedback, passing along to the eng team. We can do a better job with the messaging here

Agent: Alex Mullans confirming you are able to access now though?

User: yep!

User: Landon Howa is this the normal process, request via Opal? Is there no way to auto-approve anyone that wants to access enterpret via a link?

User: (FWIW Opal auto-approved my request, so it was quick)

User: Hey Michael, like Alex mentioned, this is setup to auto approve if you are an FTE already. Just have to go to the link and hit request :slightly_smiling_face: . Its possible to auto-assign to specific departments for example so they dont have to request, but this may be overkill if not everyone needs access.

User: oh perfect! we can revisit that once we get wider adoption and engagement!

User: Sounds good!

","The user faced an issue with the new SSO sign-in process after the migration to Okta/Opal at Enterpret Inc. The agent guided the user to request access via Opal, which resolved the issue. The user suggested improving the error messaging for SSO failures. The agent acknowledged the feedback and confirmed that the process is set to auto-approve for full-time employees.

Madison Kohls is making changes to our zendesk model upstream from Enterpret. Are there additional steps or changes you guys need to make to ensure it flows through the platform properly? Starting a :thread:

Agent: it depends
can you share more detail on the changes?

User: We appended new columns to the table we sync over to you all, nothing has been removed (they are more metadata columns)!

Agent: shouldnt be a problem on our end and ideally the data should just start flowing over naturally
The only tricky part would be if you want us to backfill the existing data we have already ingested with the new metadata or to only have it populated moving forward?

User: Backfilling would be great, i backfilled the table on our end so curious how that would work for you all

Agent: its doable, but I will need to get my engineering team involved. let me check back with them to see what might be needed to get this done
When did these changes go into effect? (asking with the real intention of checking to see what columns were added to confirm I am ingesting them)

User: I believe yesterday

Agent: whats a new column I should look for?

User: ticket_contact_reason_tag

Agent: hmmm I am not seeing any data with that present yet. But I think you haven't synced any data to us today yet either - I'll check back after the sync

Agent: Madison Kohls we have not ingested any new data with this additional metadata - because we have not ingested any new data since Feb 27
Checked with my eng team and we are actually getting an authorization error for `CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_TICKETS` could this be related to the change you made?

User: Let me flag this to those who supported my change

User: I can confirm the DBT job has been running successfully and materializing.
```00:03:50 3 of 3 OK created sql incremental model ENTERPRET_SHARED_DATA.public.customer_feedback_tickets_materialized [SUCCESS 721 in 75.89s]```
While not very familiar with enterpret UI, I don't see any error messages there either.
We can loop in DI if needed.

Agent: Is there anything that would have changed with the permissions or authentication in the last 2 days?

Agent: For reference, here is the article for how the integration works on our side
<<STRICT_LINK>>

User: I see, let me check the exposures

User: The table was recreated yesterday for the backfill, so it seems likely that some permission changed somehow

User: Hi <!subteam^S03M4F9LS9M> - I see the environment associated with Enterpret uses the now defunct ETL role. See <<STRICT_LINK>>. Could someone from DI please replace the role in the job if that is in fact the issue and also update the ownership of the tables in question?
*Urgency:* Medium

User: Hi Jack Divita, could you help me understand how I can find out the connection details (user, role, etc) from the UI?

User: Michael Wu do you happen to know how enterpret connection is set up?

User: it doesn’t let me edit the configuration i’m guessing you can only see it on creation?

User: I was expecting at least an enterpret user and a role in Snowflake but I can’t find any

User: on DI side the credentials are created here: <<STRICT_LINK>>
these credentials work on a separate reader account created here: <<STRICT_LINK>>
(and so if we’re to debug query history we’d have to see the query history from within the reader account)

User: ah got it, i’ll try there

Agent: &gt; it doesn’t let me edit the configuration i’m guessing you can only see it on creation?
I believe this is the case as well.
I am looping a couple engineers from our side to help with this as well, ideally we would be able to update the credentials of the existing integrations (perhaps something we can do on our backend as needed :thinking_face: ) because I would want to avoid re-syncing the entire table
cc Ishita Mundhra Vivek Kaushal - can we help Figma correct/debug this

User: I can see the problem being not the auth (I can log in with the same credentials, and I see query history from today). But there’s only `customer_feedback_reviews`, not the other one, and that could be the problem.

Agent: we haven't seen any issues with `customer_feedback_reviews` just `CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_TICKETS`

User: This is fixed now!
The issue is that when a view is recreated, the grant to the reader account is not applied automatically, and there’s no way to automate that (future grants to shares are not allowed). So as long as we don’t manually recreate views, we’ll be good.

User: Note for DS would be to inform DI when a full-refresh is performed for enterpret tables. Thanks Peng Wang.

Agent: amazing - thank you all for your help! I will monitor from our side to see when we see the data flowing again

User: Yazad Khambata can we document this somewhere? So we can simply point data infra oncall to the few commands they need to run.

User: I will ping you privately

Will add the gong call in the replys:
thanks for your understanding on the call — looking forward to staying in touch.
Here’s some of our team’s verbatims from the trial:
&gt; Here’s my early thoughts + questions on Enterpret as I’m going through:
&gt; • So it pulls and creates summaries from our customer feedback channels based on keywords we specifically tag? Or can it tag automatically based on the nature of customer feedback. e.g. if we’re not tracking “agency” or “billable hours”, it can still search + create a summary based on that? Pretty powerful if so. EDIT: It can, that’s awesome! This feature alone will solidify &amp; finalise my agency positioning work :raised_hands<IP>skin-tone-5:
&gt; • I love that the feedback summary can be created based on feedback from a specific time period. Last 3 months is the perfect preset for what I’m working on.
&gt; • The sentiment analysis is brilliant too - being able to see + filter based on this is very helpful for answering questions about why people did or didn’t switch to Float / how we’re currently serving a particular group.
&gt; • Email subscription is a great win too, as it’ll help centralise insights in a given period in one place; so I can share them internally
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Curious to learn about its analytics and reporting capabilities + how confident do we feel we can trust the data and summaries it provides us. Especially if we’re going to be making key big product x marketing bets from this.
&gt; • Quantify = Sum of MRR x feedback reason = This is gold! Showing the MRR impact/churn from each feedback reason is powerful; enables us to build better features x marketing that serves our best fit customers.
&gt; • Segmentation is a key component here though, would like to see how far we can drill into each reason and split it by market, segment, use case, MRR etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I think it’s better than what we have for sure, based on it’s centralised customer feedback analysis features. Unsure how much it costs, but I imagine it’s a low-to-mid 5-figure ACV product, based on the functionality on show here.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions to ask here to move forward from my perspective:
&gt; • Does it require someone to manually feed the model every week to continue getting good results. e.g. building the taxonomy and merging reasons into perpetuity etc seems like a time-consuming job for a poor soul :sweat_smile:
&gt; • How can we use it to help inform our product x PMM OKRs, like Figma did at company level?
&gt; • For queries that are hyper-specific and new: e.g. time-zones etc, the data &amp; summaries it provides will certainly be more surface-level compared to items around billing, allocations, other core product features
&gt; • Can this be replicated with a CustomGPT from Open AI? Could we feed it all our data and have it spit out what we need?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Other than that, I think it’s very powerful - we just need to set it up right.
&gt; The Summary inevitably end-up me wanting to know more.
&gt; 
&gt; Example:
&gt; • Issue with adding Project Dates
&gt; The summary returned:
&gt; The feedback on Float indicates that users are experiencing difficulties when trying to add start and end dates to their projects.
&gt; • *Confusion Over Adding Project Dates*: Users have reported an *Issue With Adding Project Dates*
&gt; ◦ They are unsure about how to find and set the start and end dates for their projects
&gt; ◦ This confusion is prevalent among users, leading to difficulties in project management.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Which, is fine but of course gives me no context as to why or what they are trying to achieve.
&gt; But, I was also a little surprised to see only *2 FeedBack Records (over 12mth period)* :thinking_face:
&gt; 
&gt; I do like that it pulls in Community Slack records - would this act as a permanent store for this data? (that alone could be worth the cost)
&gt; 
&gt; Over in Quantify:
&gt; I tried filtering on Keywords like ‘Google calendar’ and ‘API’ - all <<STRICT_LINK> saw was a lot of support conversations>, which are not particularly useful to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m still left wondering if our numbers are too small to be meaningful, I’m concerned the ‘Summary’ statements are confidently expressed based on 1 or 2 pieces of feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, not really sure how this ties into a Feature Request system. There’s something appealing to me to know we have requests logged somewhere, ideally with some Product thinking notes jotted down but crucially with some verbatim comments from customers. If this is going to reinterpret the results everytime and pull out maybe that’s a good thing but it’s going to be hard to grasp what a ‘request’ is.
&gt; I’m impressed with the concept of searching for terms and then being able to filter results to get to a data set that you can then dig into. If we are searching on the full range of user feedback from all tools as it looks to be that’s very powerful and a huge timesaver right there.
&gt; 
&gt; My main concerns are:
&gt; • Confidence that we are searching all data sources and not missing anything
&gt; • Confidence that the AI is interpreting feedback as we would. I found that when I put a csv of user feedback through ChatGPT (for rates) and asked it to group the themes and tally them it struggled to do this as well as one of us would. It was likely lacking a lot of context around the terms we use for the app, industry terms and then oftentimes a word means something different in the sentence because resource, planning, calendar.. they can all be applied in very different contexts.
&gt; • LOE to keep it well fed with data and context. Who owns this?
&gt; • How it connects to feature requests.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On the last point, connecting to feature requests, could we import our feature requests list from Linear and then have the AI link any relevant feedback to each request in Enterpret? Then we could pull up a feature request in Enterpret and see all the related user feedback including the customers that have requested it. If we can then dismiss inaccurate links, presumably the model can improve at making good connections?
&gt; 
&gt; Would be pretty cool if that is integrated so person adds a feature request in Linear, Enterpret auto-links all relevant user feedback to the request (in Enterpret), then it’s all their ready when we evaluate the request.
&gt; Looks pretty slick! I was looking for feedback related to Placeholders yesterday and it was very helpful.
&gt; • It’s great you can open Intercom &amp; Gong conversations and have the relevant conversation part immediately available
&gt; • It did seem like we need to do some gardening/add some data sources but I’m very impressed seeing this v1 experience
&gt; • The ability to search and filter by sentiment, customer/company attributes (like MRR), is huuuuuuge :raised_hands:
&gt; • Importing everything seems to create some noise (e.g. I don’t need to see all the feedback about payment declines) but it looks like we can filter that out and create dashboards ourselves
&gt; ◦ It looks like it’s importing Intercom conversation tags which we could use to setup a process with CS to help here

I uploaded the CSV with the prompt “Provide a summary for the most common things that are keeping people from remote recording today. Include counts when possible.” The response it gave me back was very much the sort of response I was expecting/desiring to get back when testing out the new “Wisdom” experience in Enterpret.

User: Here’s the response:
&gt; The analysis of survey responses regarding what’s currently keeping people from remote recording today reveals a wide variety of reasons, with each unique reason mentioned by only one respondent, indicating a high degree of specificity and diversity in the barriers faced. Here are some insights based on the data:
&gt; • **Unique Reasons**: There are 91 unique reasons mentioned for not recording remotely. Some of these include not having the function yet, procrastination, uncertainty about where to record, not being ready to coordinate with others, needing an easier solution, not having equipment, and just not getting around to creating content of this kind.
&gt; • **Keyword Insights**: By analyzing the frequency of words used in the responses (after removing common stopwords), we find several key themes:
&gt; ◦ **Need (16 mentions)**: A significant number of respondents indicate a need for something, possibly resources, information, or capabilities, that they currently lack.
&gt; ◦ **Time and Preparation (24 mentions combined)**: Words like “yet” (14), “time” (10), “havent” (11), and “no” (8) suggest that issues related to timing, readiness, and availability of resources are common barriers.
&gt; ◦ **Technical and Process Uncertainty (9 mentions of ‘how’)**: The frequency of the word “how” suggests that uncertainty about the process or technical aspects of remote recording is a barrier for some.
&gt; ◦ **Procrastination and Motivation**: The mention of “procrastinating” as a reason, along with the implicit suggestion of delay in words like “yet” and “havent,” points to procrastination or a lack of motivation as factors.
&gt; 
&gt; These insights indicate a complex landscape of barriers to remote recording, including technical challenges, lack of resources, timing and readiness issues, and motivational factors. Each respondent appears to have a unique set of challenges, underscoring the need for tailored solutions to address these barriers.

Agent: Agreed - chat GPT did a better job of understanding the intention of the question revolved around `keeping people from remote recording today` but chatgpt wont give you the citations to see the quotes themselves

Agent: but even having the ciations in this case (i assume) is actually not as useful because we didn't quite understand the question correctly - we anchored on general complaints remote recording instead of focusing on what users said was preventing them from using it

1. From the docs it looks like we can test SSO with enforcing.
2. Am I able to give you the Issuer, client ID, and Client Secret or does it need to be an admin in Enterpret from Figma?
3. I see that you support user deprovisioning via an event hook and just wanted to confirm the OIDC connection supports provisioning of some sort, perhaps jit?

Generic SSO configuration guide: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Okta configuration guide: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Okta user provisioning and deprovisioning guide: <<STRICT_LINK>>

Yes, this is correct
&gt; 1. Am I able to give you the Issuer, client ID, and Client Secret or does it need to be an admin in Enterpret from Figma?
I would recommend an Enterpret Admin at Figma be the one to configure this. Currently your admin is Michael Nguyen, it is also easy for us to give you admin access to configure this yourself if that is better?
Some context on this ^ there isn't much harm in enabling more admin users. This is one of the few things governed by admin permissions today
&gt; 1. I see that you support user deprovisioning via an event hook and just wanted to confirm the OIDC connection supports provisioning of some sort, perhaps jit?
My understanding is that this is supported (on account of our other customers who are currently gating access through SSO), but I am not as familiar with the technical workings. If this is unclear from the documentation I can loop in my eng team, but I think this should work

*Users are experiencing confusion and dissatisfaction with unexpected charges for additional seats, especially when collaborating with other Professional Plan users.*
• _“I found it really weird”_ <<STRICT_LINK> |[1]>
*Users are seeking refunds for unused periods and unexpected charges, often due to confusion about the billing system.*
• _“Is it possible to request a refund for &lt;DATE_TIME&gt;. Since we weren't actually using the paid features.”_ <<STRICT_LINK> |[2]>
*Users are requesting assistance with account management tasks such as cancelling plans, removing invoices, and altering the number of seats.*
• _“Hi, I have tried to cancel my account but the instructions on your website haven't helped I cant find the buttons you said to and then it said id get an email to say if I wanted to continue my subscription which I didn't, can someone your end please cancel it and can I get the money refunded as I cant directly cancel the subscription and I don't have the money to be paying this subscription.”_ <<STRICT_LINK> |[3]>
*Users are seeking clarification on Figma's billing and pricing system, including the cost of seats and the impact of reducing the number of seats.*
• _“Hello, I have a question on the amount of billing. We have paid 2160$ in &lt;DATE_TIME&gt; for &lt;DATE_TIME&gt; subscription. At this time we had 4 design seats. In &lt;DATE_TIME&gt;, we had 1 design seat and 2 figjam seats. So we lowered our subscription right ? Then &lt;DATE_TIME&gt; I removed the figjam seats &amp; limited the deisgn seats to 3 and the dev mode seats to 1. Why should we pay more then ? What is the price of each seats. And do we have credits since we lower our number of seats? Thank you for explaining me because I don't really understand the tarification and the add on to pay.”_ <<STRICT_LINK> |[4]>
*Users are facing issues with account access due to billing issues, such as extra full seats being added to their team.*

I'm helping Heath Rogers and Norman Lemke find dev mode tickets for the last week, filtered by plan type or paid tier. AKA, what customers are writing in request a cancel.
I'm not seeing any unified of source meta data fields that I can filter on for paid status, even though it's flowing through when I look at the meta date on a specific ticket and in the CSV exports. Here's a quick and dirty video.

Agent: checking

User: but Heath Rogers figured out if you just type ""max paid"" it shows up...

Agent: looks like a bug, but shouldnt be a blocker

Agent: ^ yes this

Agent: not sure why its not showing up in the UI when you click that section - I am raising that with my engineering team. But if you search the terms from the query builder it will show up

User: ok. not urgent. but also means we need to do a clean up and better mapping of our metadata. This is related to the proposed changes that Madison Kohls is proposing.

Agent: Looking a little medium term. We are actively working on some improvements to the unified fields which should be live in the coming weeks, that will help with this. Could also be an opportunity to sync the user/account level metadata (not just feedback data)

Key sources:

Front
NPS/Survey responses (Survey Monkey/Delighted)
Intercom
Forums (Discourse)

First call was primarily around high level overview of Enterpret. Both of these folks are on the user research team. Peter is more focused on interveiws/community work, and Elena is more focused on the data piece. She's his data counterpart.

Spent the bulk of today's call talking about core use cases/what they're having issues with today. 

This is a bit less about product strategy, and more about having the right data/eliminating institutional knowledge.

""we know what the top 10/10 issues are, and how to work on those, but need more data around the 2s and 3s""

They work primarily with the self serve team, and there's not as much visibility into what that group needs/is asking for.

Talked about process today. There is something roughly in place for tickets as far as front goes, but they certainly miss some things in manually tagging. 

Asked about wanting to go through and measure impact, and segment out by new users vs power users etc. 

This is clearly not a top priority for the organization today- there is no budget, this team is proactively looking for solutions. Said competitors were quoting about a 3rd of the price we shared. 

Bottom line: this is not a great opp for a multitude of reasons. Going to connect on 3/12 to see when makes sense to potentially do a trial, but will need to continue to push on the pricing piece/getting others involved/internal priority.",,2024-04-19T19:26:39.000+0000,2024-04-02,,Paul Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-Noticed that analysis of feedback is lacking
-Wants there to be one place where product and research can go to see feedback and quickly consume feedback that’s relevant to them, need to more organized and transparent with feedback management
-Not sure if we need something that is purely a customer feedback tool or something, or if they need an to end Product Management tool like Airfocus
-Entire team is in Notion right now for Product Management
-Need to be careful in deciding what we need right now because we don’t want to tool hop
-Looked at a few tools already
-Selfishly she wants something that automates the analysis and summarization of feedback, what are people saying, how many people are saying it, etc…
-Tried Kraftful, but said its very basic and she can basically already do the same stuff with ChatGPT
-Want to have analysis of feedback so when leadership asks why we’re building something, we can show them the feedback, the segmentation, etc...
-receiving feedback via surveys, her colleague Max has a VOC program where he’s doing user interviews, support, cs, every source is important (gong, typeform, Zendesk)
-no process for unifying or analyzing, feedback is randomly shared in slack
-want to look at feedback over the last three months and be able to say, What is it actually telling us? Where should we focus? Why should we focus on that and then be able to go back to the commercial team and say this is what we’re doing and why
-How do you want to segment feedback? By product teams, so probably keywords
-Want to quickly see what people are saying talk therapy for example
-Asking about the ability to close the loop with customers
-Her overall thoughts: insights in enterpret better are better than Airfocus, but also Airfocus is end-to-end PM tool, need to discuss internally about what type of tool they need right now
-VP of Product wasn’t aware of evaluation at the time of the call, her and Max wanted to do research first and let her know what the options are, pros and cons, etc

Specifically, on Zendesk we see a big spike in tickets on Feb 1 (see 2nd image), but through Enterpret, it looks like there's not a spike until Feb 7.
What could be driving that difference?
• Is there a 6-day lag in when Enterpret gets the tickets?
• If not, what else could be driving this difference?
• Does this only assess sentiment analysis on first contact, or does each subsequent contact get a sentiment analysis?
Would love your thoughts on this Jack Divita

User: Molly Jane Nicholas do you know if the zendesk tickets are looking at ticket creation date or ticket resolution date?

User: Laura Perea Heath Rogers Do either of you know the answer to the above?

User: Kait Schorr has been looking into the snowflake &gt; Enterpret pipeline and might have a pov.

Agent: This delay wouldnt be coming from our side. That being said, at a glance I suspect the root cause is that you are sending us the close date as the created date

User: I'm looking into this more today, I'll focus on Zendesk differences! This is helpful

User: I'm going to put together a doc of my findings for both sources and hopefully we can find someone to own it long term so we don't have the ambiguity around troubleshooting. Feel free to send me any details or weirdness you're observing.

User: fwiw My hypothesis is the state in which entepret ingest the tickets is different from the state in which zendesk is reporting the ticket dates.

User: The state of the ticket itself? I think I remember someone (maybe you!) Mentioning that. I will investigate that angle as well

User: This is already helpful all! It does seem clear that it's related to the state, and not some weird issue with incorrectly tagging, so I'll communicate that back to the team.

User: Molly Jane Nicholas I don't know... that was one of my questions. Norman Lemke Can you work with Kait Schorr on this?

User: The mode dash should be by creation date Norman Lemke to confirm

User: So if Enterpret is indeed close date it would be nice to switch that to match Jack Divita Michael Nguyen

User: I would also be very interested in seeing ""sentiment on creation date"" and ""sentiment of close date"" to see if there was a change throughout the life cycle of the ticket

Agent: Kait Schorr when looking at the snowflake table there will be two date fields that are required by us for ingestion:
• *ERC_CREATED_AT:* The creation timestamp of the feedback.
• *ERC_ROW_CREATED_AT:* The creation timestamp of the row in the table; helps Enterpret track what data to ingest.
Can you confirm that on your side the *`ERC_CREATED_AT`* is being mapped to the created date of the ticket itself?
Here is the link to the full documentation of our Snowflake integration if that is helpful
<<STRICT_LINK>>

User: Yes, looking now

User: So `ERC_CREATED_AT` is actually using the `UPDATED_AT` date of the ticket

User: Also the Zendesk tickets are also being filtered by the *`FEEDBACK_PROHIBITED_DOMAINS` table*

Agent: Kait Schorr can we correct the dates? We can help run a backfill on our end. Also, is that the only filter on the table? 
Michael Nguyen do we still need the prohibited domains filter?
Would it be possible to connect love sometime this week? I’d want to make sure we are all on the same page and that any updates we make fully solve the problem, so that we are not still working through this a few weeks from now 

User: The filters I've found are these:
user_id is not null
ticket status in (closed, solved, hold)
user_facts domain not in prohibited domains

User: One thing to note is we are in the middle of pulling data for an Exec Review meeting tomorrow so unless it's a quick fix we should hold Michael Nguyen Jack Divita

User: + Madison Kohls Perhaps we can capture this request to change the `ERC_CREATED_AT` to be the date the ticket was created, not the `UPDATED_AT` date in your current doc of proposed changes to the query.

User: Michael Nguyen yup! This seems to be from a model built _downstream_ of the query I am proposing. It seems like regardless we need to change the field from updated_at to created_at in this downstream model.

User: Which query are you proposing changing Madison Kohls?

User: NVM, Norman Lemke sent it to me. We should definitely set up some time to align on this

User: Yes! let me find a time for us, Michael, and Norman so I can give better context :smile:

","The user reports a discrepancy between Zendesk tickets and Enterpret's visualization of the tickets. The agent suspects that the issue might be due to the user sending the close date as the created date. The user agrees to investigate this angle further. The conversation also includes discussions about the state of the ticket, the mode dash, and the sentiment analysis on creation and close dates. The user proposes a solution to switch the close date to match and to see the sentiment change throughout the ticket's lifecycle. The agent suggests a correction of the dates and a possible backfill. The conversation ends with a plan to set up a meeting to align on the proposed changes.",enterpret-figma,https://enterpret.slack.com/archives/C03RJBY6Q7N/p1707780837577149?thread_ts=1707780837.577149&cid=C03RJBY6Q7N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ever since we integrated the Zendesk ticket data we have seen a dramatic increase in the interest in Enterpret from all of you Figmates! This week had really great training onboarding sessions with Heath Rogers (and folks from your team), and Madison Kohls as representation from the billing team.
For anyone else who might be interested in getting started with Enterpret I have included two links below that I think will be useful for you all. First is a 10 minute overview video that will cover all of the basics of what you need to know to get started, and second is my calendar link along with an open invitation for anyone at Figma who might want to ask some questions and have more of a guided onboarding:
Link to video overview of Enterpret: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Calendar link to schedule personalized product onboarding: <<STRICT_LINK>>
I also wanted to highlight some ongoing work from our team:
• Molly Jane Nicholas Has created some really amazing dashboards highlighting the feedback on the recent Dev Mode launch. There are also a number of subscriptions directly pushing summarized insights to some team-specific Slack channels - this is *exactly* how we recommend taking advantage of feedback during product launches:
 ◦ Have a home page where everyone can align on the same data + trends
 ◦ Automate pushing insights to Slack so that people can stay up to date on whats going on without having to run their own reports (allowing them to deep dive if they see something interesting)
 ◦ To checkout her dashboard follow this link here:
 ▪︎ <<STRICT_LINK>>
• There are some gaps in the Zendesk data that we are working through. All of the analysis you can do in Enterpret will be correct, but there is a chance it is not fully complete as we are not ingesting every single support ticket. You can follow along with the progress in the thread linked below:
 ◦ <<STRICT_LINK>>
• This week we launched the beta version of our chat interface called `Wisdom` - this will allow you to ask questions and learn from your customer feedback through normal natural language (as opposed to constructing a query through our UI)
 ◦ I have attached an example of what this type of interface looks like

Summarizing our call below:
tl;dr - you can sync user + account metadata to Enterpret to enable advanced reporting on customer feedback, for example:
• Understanding the revenue impact of different reasons for feedback
• Understanding root causes behind user churn
• Understanding major causes for friction in user onboarding+activation 
The easiest way to set this up is to start syncing this data to us through Census, the documentation for setting this up is included below. You can sync any type of metadata to us as a part of this sync, the most important part is that we have a primary key that we can use to join against your existing feedback data. From Zendesk we are receiving a variety of different ID's along with the user email but it sounds like the best one to use would be the Notion user ID - which we are receiving in two different formats (which I have highlighted in the example below) - these two fields seem to be populated on about 77% of Zendesk tickets we have received in the last 3 months

1. We need clarity on what data is being analyzed, and, even more importantly, what data is not being analyzed
2. We need to know who to go to when we want to make changes to the data model
 a. From my conversation with the support team this week there are new dimensions of metadata that we would want to bring in
Currently there are two snowflake tables that are being brought in to Enterpret:
• `Snowflake CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_TICKETS`
 ◦ Database name: ENTERPRET_SHARED_DATA
 ◦ This is Zendesk data
• `Snowflake CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_REVIEWS` 
 ◦ Database name: ENTERPRET_SHARED_DATA
 ◦ Customer feedback reviews table name: CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_REVIEWS
 ◦ These are Asana feedback tickets (go/voc)
For both sources we are ingesting a value for `erc_id` which, best as I know, represents the unique ID for each record on the Figma side. Based on previous conversations, I know that we are not being sent every single record for each of these sources - but it is not clear what the criteria being used to determine what records are sent to us. Even if we do not change this definition, I think it will be very helpful for everyone involved if we can atleast share this definition
I have included some analysis from my side to help with this investigation, but ultimately we will need someone from the Figma data engineering team to own this. For the Zendesk ERC ID's, they appear to be sequential and make me think that you are sending us roughly 40% of tickets. The asana ticket ID's do not appear to be sequential.
Spreadsheet with extract of ticket ID's: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Who would be the right person to ask about this and to own this moving forward from the Figma team? Is there any other data I can provide from the Enterpret side to help with this?

User: Hey Jack! Thanks for putting this together. I will hop in and help figure this out, or at least hunt down an owner.

Agent: Amazing - thank you so much!
Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help

User: thank you so much Kait Schorr This is gonna be a huge win for us! :pray<IP>skin-tone-3:

User: Looking into the Asana tickets (so `CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_REVIEWS` and they aren't actually incremental, they are randomly generated unique numbers, so the gaps between the numbers doesn't signify missing tickets. the `erc_id` is indeed the task id number, though, and you can only see it when you're using asana in the browser (it's the last bit of the url)

User: yup but see examples in previous threads where we _are_ missing some tickets and we don't understand why

User: Understood! I'm still digging into it, just wanted to share that finding since the spreadsheet was calculating the jumps between Asana tickets as well. I'm looking at the queries and I will trace them from the source and see where/why things are dropping off

User: For the Asana tickets, anything from the following domains is filtered out according to the query:

User: As well as only tickets generated in this project:
```ID: <CREDIT_CARD>
Name: VoC Needs ```

",The user and agent are discussing the need for a clear definition and owner of the snowflake tables being ingested into Enterpret. They are also trying to understand the criteria used to determine which records are sent. The user is investigating the issue of missing tickets and is sharing their findings with the agent. The agent appreciates the user's help and offers further assistance.,enterpret-figma,https://enterpret.slack.com/archives/C03RJBY6Q7N/p1707349315099479?thread_ts=1707349315.099479&cid=C03RJBY6Q7N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Fred Kang - Once we have the list we'll need your help along with the PM who owns playbooks to validate which reasons, and how they're defined, that we want to set up in Enterpret. 
3. Jack Divita - Once 2 is completed, I'll work with you to create the new reasons and merge existing reasons. From there hopefully we can do a quick refresh in Enterpret to see what it is able to pull in a report. The PM Owners can then validate whether the updates were helpful.

Inês Lebres can you be more specific on what you are looking for? Are you curious about how people are reacting to the conference itself, or to the products announced at the conference?

Agent: Hi Grant Orchard, it looks like something may have changed in the Census configuration – we are seeing that there is no column designated as containing the user feedback, which is done (as per step 4b <<STRICT_LINK>>) by pre-pending ""feedback_"" to the column name. Let me know if you want to jump on a quick call to debug.

• Fine tune taxonomy for more granular and actionable outputs
 ◦ Now that the taxonomy is fully customizable I recommend we follow a thorough and systematic approach by tackling key areas one by one sequentially. I am happy to help put in work on this front to help guide, but I cannot be the one making the tactical decisions on reason definitions
 ▪︎ I will never know your business and your priorities as well as you all. Who would be best for me to work with on this front? Mitch Louie should this be me and you?
• Nail down core use cases
 ◦ Manjit Toor I want your monthly support summaries to be as automated as possible. Using this template should get you 90% of the way there, do you agree?
 ▪︎ <<STRICT_LINK>>
• Expand to more core use cases
 ◦ Julia Bendix I know there are other executive reports outside of monthly support tickets that you were hoping to be sharing. Can you share some examples of what those might be?
• Expand to decentralized insight production
 ◦ At our other customers we have seen VOC have a lot of success by sponsoring dedicated Enterpret training sessions with product, support, and operations stakeholders (anyone who might have some use for customer feedback in their day to day). We spend 45 minutes together and by the end of it people know how to create their own reports and find their own insights
 ◦ I think we should be aiming to start running sessions like these by late February/early March when we have spent some more time fine tuning the taxonomy
 ▪︎ Julia Bendix How do you feel about that timeline? Any initial thoughts on who some of these teams who might benefit most from using feedback first hand would be?

User: Re: Taxonomy fine tuning - yep that would be me. Fred Kang would you or anyone on your team like to be involved?

User: Mitch Louie yep we can start with me and i can pull people in as necessary

-NPS surveys sent regularly, lots of open-ended responses, 20 questions but about 3 of them are open-text responses
-Started in UK, now in more countries, feedback is in more languages which is becoming difficult to analyze
-Easy to get people to provide feedback, people like talking about their weddings
-Has tried incorporated AI into feedback even before chatGPT came out, found that the tagging was worse than her own tagging
-volume is growing and become more difficult to keep up with
-also doing user interviews on Grain
-the bride book app has lots of feature so range of feedback topics is diverse
-they do user interviews where they ask people for feedback that isn’t necessarily about the product, and is more about weddings in general, wondering how enterpret’s analysis of those calls would look
-kept saying its cool, but she was wondering what you’re supposed to do when you come into enterpret
-asked about ability to compare feedback in across different countries
-appstore feedback is generally just positive, not super actionable
-volume is 5k to 10k surveys per year sent throughout the wedding planning process


Where are you at in your discovery process?
-Just starting to reinvestigate these kinds of tools
-looked at chattermill a few years ago but it was expensive and rigid


-Found us through Notion VOC template","<p>Their volume is only 5k-6k items/year. Also, the price tag of $25k is out of their range.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not a good fit, and not worth the time and effort.</p>",2024-02-27T21:19:53.000+0000,2024-02-27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Had a brief chat with Julio Henriquez this morning and he confirmed it would be a useful dimension to include for analyzing feedback
If so, i think it would be useful to include it in future sync. Also, in order to avoid having to go through this process again and again, are there any other relevant fields we should include at the same time? Right now you are sending us `tier` , `arr` , `churn date` . We have also seen other teams have success by syncing `type` , `onboarding date` , and `geography` - would any of these also be useful to include too?
Nathan Yoon any thoughts on other dimensions the leadership team might be interested to slice the data by in future analysis?

User: Hey Jack Divita - to get anything else added, Nathan Yoon will have to submit a BI Intake Request as we don't have any dedicated Enterpret support from BI for Q1 and my current sprint is fully booked.
Nathan Yoon; when you submit the Intake, please provide a comprehensive list of the columns you'd like to be added and to which Enterpret objects.
Some initial clarifying questions (can be answered here or on intake);
• `number of seats used` - is this the total number of seats on the account/team, paid seats on the account/team, number of paid and active users, or something else?
• can you explain what you mean by `type`?
• what level of granularity are you looking at for `geography`? Global region (EMEA, APAC, AMER, etc.), country, something else?

User: Hey Isaac - to clarify - looks like this is a request from Julio. Julio Henriquez can you please submit a ticket per the instructions above^?

User: Thanks Nathan Yoon - my apologies, I misread the message. Julio Henriquez; if you could submit a <<STRICT_LINK> Intake Request> with the above provided so we can get this scoped, that would be appreciated. Thanks!

","The user requests the inclusion of the 'number of seats used' attribute in the account metadata synced to Enterpret for better data analysis.

Program Manager for scaled GTM. Paul had initially reached out to Julian, (Scaled GTM guy) who is looking for a new survey solution and suggested Katy connect with us.

Been on his team for 4-5 months now. Julian has PMM background, but now runs the scaled group. 

Two core use cases:
1- For scaled customers under a certain spend threshold, ""how do we move them upstream?"" 
2- Also responsible for overall VoC program across all accounts. 

Want to centralize feedback from NPS and CSAT Surveys. CSM feedback etc. Centralize it all, because the current state is ""pretty immature"". Collecting the feedback but it's not being utilized. 

Collected in a google sheet, or NPS responses are being sent to an inbox that you can read through 1 by 1. Don't have a place where all surveys are, so has to be pulled manually once a quarter. Looking to democratize this to:
- Improve decision making
- Reduce churn. 

Want to have an individual user be able to onboard better when they hop in. How do we help them to adopt.

Sources:
NPS - Gainsight (where the core emailed ones are) they are deprecating this in August, new solution in place by July 1st
CSAT - is via Pendo (specific product related CSAT) would want to pull that in as well. 
Zendesk- ""Post interaction surveys"" 
Gong- Some CS feedback there today, but also google sheets, SFDC where things are getting logged. 

Really siloed today. Focus is NPS/CSAT for her, support is in their own world doing their own thing. Would entertain pulling in Zendesk and seeing what makes sense to pull in today. 

Thinking of this as phase 1 phase 2 ""what is the basic thing we could get in place by 7/1"" after we're for sure we don't have a gap in surveying customers. 

They do have Survey Monkey, and not concerned with no Gainsight since they're moving off. 

Closing the loop is a big part of the equation as well. What exists to give different personas visibility, how do folks get notified of anomalous activity. 

Could do the following:
1- Gainsight v looker
2- Survery moneky and then a tool like Enterpret
3- All in one with something like qualtrics to send out the surveys etc. 

Think about feedback in a more wholistic way.

Having some more demos/internal conversations, particularly with folks working with Zendesk etc. 

Use RedShift as well. 

Connecting 3/20 now for next steps feedback/initial pricing.

Suggested doing Zendesk integration, Gong integration, then maybe a CSV for surveys. Still some concerns as for trials they've done in the past having a ton of approvals... so CSV uploads across the board might be easier.

3/25- ""Hi James, I am so sorry to cancel this. I am still chatting with procurement about our path forward, can I reach back out when I have more info?""

This is not a particularly strong opp. Primary point of contact is Katy Durkin katy.durkin@lattice.com.","<p><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">We decided to go with a solution that could also send the surveys.

Here is the latest update from our side, let me know if its helpful to give the time on the calendar back today
Open Issues:
• Failed to copy summary to clipboard
 ◦ Workaround identified, root problem still not resolved
• Updating incorrectly uploaded feedback records
 ◦ Mike shared the correct doc - this will be corrected next week
• more bars then values in the table 
 ◦ root cause identified, haven't been able to ship a fix yet
• % vs. numbers on charts 
 ◦ in progress
Medium term requests:
• Support for Discord forums
 ◦ I cant make any promises on timeline yet, but we did just have another customer ask for the same thing. It will likely still be months, not weeks, but I am working internally to make the case we should add this to the roadmap. I'll keep you up to date on any progress
Updates:
• We will be starting our chatbot interface beta sometime next week or the week after. I'll let you know when we are ready to turn it on for Descript since we expect this will be really helpful for you all and we've greatly appreciated your feedback on all other aspects of the product

-Float is focused on SMB and Mid-market, been around 13 years, in growth mode, 4,500 customers
-Looking inward at how we’re capturing and prioritizing customer feedback
-Previously used Trello to capture feature requests, started using Canny but it’s not sticking and not valuable, we’re more strategic about feedback than just looking at most upvoted feature
-Want to understand segmentation, industry, and who’s requesting certain features
-Sources include Intercom, Gong, Slack community
-Don’t prioritize based on most requested feature, 
-Want to segment feedback, key persona is people planning warrior which is defined as professionals services, 1-1000 team members, usually a role in operations
-Did a self-serve trial with Kraftful, - wasn’t impressed, seemed similar to just copy and pasting feedback to ChatGPT
-Likes Figma slide, they’re having a problem with defining OKRs with product focused metrics
-Liked the co-occuring reasons 
-Liked demo a lot, said it solves a lot of the challenges they’re having with categorization 
-Not sure about volume (ballpark 100 Gong calls)

2/1- spoke with team after sharing numbers $20-$25k annually. Said the budget is a feasible, but it's a bit high compared to what they're spending today. 

Mentioned $10k for Gong with one rep... Told him no doubt we'd be able to work with him (case study or logo rights)

Going to test the following:
Intercom: ~1200 per month
G2: ~10 per month
Gong: ~85 calls per month
Slack: ~30-50 messages a month

Colin (data scientist) had some concerns around slack, and picking up on non feedback, or feedback within slack replys. Told him we should try and see.

Colin also had concerns around the Hubspot integration, essentially said they would need a firm date on this as there's a ton of data on closed lost reasons etc. Makes sense, and potentially something we can make a contractual commitment on if we end up being a good fit.

Talked about the ""merging"" and ""marrying"" of Gong/Slack and Intercom, considering their metadata is extremely rich in intercom. Need to see if this is potential synced users and accounts.

Agreed to a 10 day trial period, and agreed to start with Intercom, G2, Slack and Gong, and not pull in the metadata with Hubspot at this time. We may have to do that at the end to win this deal.

This is a very real opp, we will have to discount, but need to focus on technical fit.

Sent a slack invite and instructions to get started, created an instance, and they will add the sources before EOW. 

Connecting on 2/8 to go through success criteria/journey deck.

2/8- Solid call, seemed like sorting by user types etc and MRR was the key use case here, so pushed for Census.

Got notified that if they exported from Census, they would need to upgrade accordingly so they will not for the PoV.

Jack is going to manually put together user and accounts modeling. 

They've asked a TON of questions around taxonomy etc, so will continue to partner with them. Had some legit concerns, but quite frankly I'm glad we're addressing prior to getting started on a PoV. 

PoV kickoff 2/15

2/15- Solid pov kickoff. Really got to the core of what we do before our formal kickoff. Started 10 day trial period. 

Asked a ton of questions around a few things:
- confidence in the data- ""If I share this internally, I need to be 100% confident things aren't being double counted etc"". 
- Taxonomy manual work (how much time will be spent fine tuning).

Overall seemed positive. They are sharing with the extended team this afternoon, and we will reconnect next week.","<p>Talked about data accuracy, but truly this comes down to low volume, and the ability to get what they need manually at this time. Will be a good opportunity down the road when they have more volume than they know what to do with. </p>",,2024-02-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His journey as a Insight Consumer (PM) starts usually at Keywords -> Feedback Records -> Open in Search -> Scroll each feedback record cursorily -> Read through Summary. Post this he checks if the summary is relevant from his tribal knowledge, in many cases it is sparse insights that he is able to derive from this. Like <<STRICT_LINK>> he is sure that Issue with _*Ability To Export Data*_ and _*Need for Ground Control Points Assistance: Users are seeking Help With Ground Control Points 19*_ are not applicable in context of the Keyword here - Google Earth.
All in all he is very happy with the Summaries direction as it is efficient for him to read multiple summaries, and extract meaningful insights from that as opposed to rabbit holing in Quantify land. One nit that he had though was that feedback generally starts from X records, but quotes show a very lesser number of feedback records Y, as part of summary (where Y<<<<X). His expectation was that it'd be aggregate validated. (X/X)
His general user journey is Keywords -> Feedback Records -> Open in Search -> Scroll each feedback record cursorily -> Read through Summary. Post this, he nuances this as part of a Coda doc wherein he adds EG1, EG2, EG3 (examples of Summary quotes, or favorited Feedback records) in a doc and finalizes a breakdown doc, which can then be used by PMs/URs/Designers in his areas to pick up Discovery for. (SS attached)
For Taxonomy -
• Keywords are very useful, but there is a lot of keywords that are redundant or unusable due to being very broad in nature. There is no capability to hierarchically manage these.
• He was pretty gung-ho about Reasons initially, but found them to be too broad in many cases, even if granular reasons are present, they are not top of mind due to the attribution of records towards broader reasons being really up the pecking order.
• He had heard from the team on 'parent-child' relation of keywords and reasons as part of T3, wasn't sold on the idea, but when I took him through the broad idea of customisable nodes, which can have <<STRICT_LINK> to many relationship> , he mentioned he was excited about the direction as this might reduce the noise a lot.
• He would want this relationship to be auto-generated as Admin'ing the Taxonomy(clean-up, merges, creations) is something he hates as a PM and would ideally need AI to fill that gap.
• He commented that currently reasons and keywords operate in a standalone manner, but should be more contextual and mappable (again not by humans, but by AI)
• He also mentioned that each feedback record, shows a lot of incorrect predictions for Categories, even when he starts from a completely different keywords in place and this is misleading and erodes his trust on the tool. (SS attached)
I also updated him on Oracle and he was super excited for this, as , paraphrasing - ""For me to uncover insights by querying in natural language and see just not text, but list of Feedback records, visualizations, summaries in a single chat like interface is the direction which seems the most intuitive to me. Post having the relationships as part of Taxonomy improvements, I'm assuming the models would have a lot more context about Keywords, Reasons and their own relationships""
He'd be happy to provide feedback from Alpha stages, if required.

Agent: This is awesome Saurabh Arora, thanks for sharing! Did we get any insights on who consumes Duncan’s Coda doc and why?
Was the call recorded by any chnce?

Agent: This is consumed downstream by User researchers, Designers for discovery 

Agent: Got it. Curious about why these researches/designers don’t feel the need to visit Enterpret to read feedback about what’s identified // read adjacent feedback.

Agent: There is an additional layer of product sense and investigation required by Duncan, post finalizing the items he hands over to the research teams 

","The user, Duncan, is satisfied with Enterpret's summary feature as it allows him to extract meaningful insights efficiently. However, he suggests improvements in the feedback record count and the contextual mapping of reasons and keywords. He also expresses a dislike for managing the taxonomy and suggests AI automation for this task. Duncan's Coda doc, which contains feedback summaries, is consumed by downstream user researchers and designers for discovery, indicating a need for a more intuitive interface.",product-feedback,https://enterpret.slack.com/archives/C0512PJLE4B/p1706169204160289?thread_ts=1706169204.160289&cid=C0512PJLE4B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; I think one of the things that might help overall is if the “notifications” pane contained a log of keyword and reason additions/updates.

&gt; • I created a new reason
&gt; • I created a keyword
&gt; • I merged some reasons into one
&gt; • I added some keyword variations

Agent: Hi Louise Sellars, two potential approaches:
• <<STRICT_LINK>>: total number of _records_ that have complaints on them over time (it's broken out by source, so you could do the addition offline or just take the Zendesk figures)
• <<STRICT_LINK>>: A report on complaint reasons by week, with a single record counting towards multiple rows if it has multiple complaints. We don't provide a good way to aggregate within the app, but if you export the table as csv it should be straightforward to sum it up

I pulled some of the user and account data from Intercom records that are in Enterpret, and set up a sample User / Account sync to see if it would yield any interesting insights. One thing that I found is that the top Improvement suggestions change quite a bit when weighted by account data, in this example by the number of seats (in other words, potential seat impact of an improvement). `Ability To Assign Tasks To Multiple People` jumps from 3rd to out in front by a wide margin, while the `Ability To Create Custom Fields` drops to the bottom. A number of reasons drop out of the top 10 completely, replaced by new ones. Here are the charts:
• <<STRICT_LINK> By Feedback Count>
• <<STRICT_LINK> By Potential Seat Impact>
If this kind of analysis might be interesting, we can discuss more tomorrow about setting it up via Census, with a proper recurring sync.
A number of our customers have decided to set this up, and many are already getting value out of it. And we have decided to postpone any discussion on this being a paid feature, and are opening up access for free to all customers for the foreseeable future.

-Zendesk, Appstore, Playstore, Facebook, Twitter…
-Putting some of this feedback in Google Sheets, organized by product and certain games within the product, super manual
-people always asking how a new feature is doing and they don’t really have a great answer
-Will do more research on this topic, needs to be speak with some people internally, sounds like Director of Customer Support would want to see trial
-Volume is over 1,000 tickets per month

2/7- Had a solid Call with Heather (CS) and Nitya (User research)
The team was just in San Juan pounding Mufungo, and had been discussing better ways to make the most out of their feedback. 

Sources used:
Zendesk (8-9k per month for a small team)
App Store (50 a week)
Playstore (50 a week)
Survey Monkey (About 2000 churn surveys the last 6 months)

Nitya talks about focusing on bridging the gap from support like Heather and Emma (who couldn't attend cause sick AF) and mentioned the survey Monkey piece. Said her and the org manually go through and make sense of the survey data on why folks churn or don't renew on the existing offers.

Key thing is they do have a process that works today. They do this all via google sheets by specific producsts, specifics games within specific products etc. 

Asked a lot of questions around the practical use cases with product, and I talked through the demo that way accordingly. Here is the discovery, here's development, here's delivery and here's post delivery. This resonated well.

Asked about how to talk to product about this, and how we compare to canny. Talked through analysis v management- also resonated.

Said they're a super small team, and lots of folks might be interested in this. Going to evangelize internally, sent recordings, and shared ball park pricing $50-$60k annually. 

Need to get some more buy in on what we're doing from other folks, including product, before we proceed with a PoV.

Going to connect 2/21 to see if we're ready to start a PoV, really comes down to how much pain the rest of the org is feeling.","<p>Hi James. After a lot of discussion, we have decided to put a hold on the conversation to trial Enterpret. We were all really impressed by the product; however, we have some Product roles we are working on filling and we would like them to be a part of this discussion and decision.</p><p>Thank you again for taking the time to show us Enterpret and how we could use it for our feedback.

-asking about ability to send feedback out of Enterpret
-lots of feedback multiple sources, primary source is zendesk, support tags tickets and adds them to feature request board in Jira, 2000 feature requests in there
-Having difficulty getting PMs to add even the most heavily requested features to the roadmap as they’re just focused on the strategic roadmap

What do you think is stopping PM’s from looking at the feature request board?
-Supposed to have have 80%, 20% split on building new things vs enhancing existing things, very difficult for CX to get things over the line, even if we say $5M worth of clients are asking for this, they just say they already are allocating resources toward building other things

What do you think would allow to build a better case about why things should be prioritized?
-The more data the better, revenue behind feedback, # of accounts requesting something, # of customers at risk of churn
-Trying to do their own version of SUA but its very manual
-for example, we’ll look at the most commonly requested feature, manually sort through all the revenue that is associated with that feature request, but then we don’t even know if this feature request has the most revenue behind it because there’s so many other feature requests, and also this is just feedback from zendesk
-doing this in jira because PMs use jira and if we want to get them to consume these insights it needs to be in their language and in tools they use

-Sales is using Gong, but not everyone uses Gong, limited licenses
-would also be good to use enterpret to recruit beta users as that is something product requests from them

`Context:` I set up a bot to trigger daily at 3am pacific time to the dev-mode-external-feedback channel, but just now I checked and it doesn't look like it triggered. I expected it to either run, or to say ""there's no activity"" (see second screenshot when I had the bot going directly to me).
It's helpful to have the bot confirm there's not enough activity just as a sanity check to confirm it's working. Just now I updated the bot to send at 7am and it's still not taking any action, but I can confirm there are 5 feedback records since yesterday which has definitely been enough to trigger the bot in the past.
I also confirmed the Enterpret bot is correctly added to the channel (see last screenshot).
`Request:` Any suggestions for troubleshooting this?

User: Update on this: I've now redirected all the bots to a new channel, in hopes there's something funky happening with the slack integration that will get resolved by starting fresh. Will keep you updated on if it works when the bots all trigger.

Agent: Hi Tanner Hopkins, there is not an automatic way to only import users who have feedback in Enterpret – the sync just brings in everything from whichever table you choose. If you were to try and limit the import, you would need to do something like the following:
1. Export feedback data from Enterpret and assemble a list of users
2. Filter your source table to include only users with a matching feedback record
3. Set up the data sync from the filtered source table to Enterpret

Example: You are editing a reason and trying to decide if you should break out a definition into its own reason. Sometimes it's pretty obvious from the definition name, but, here, `issue with defective sheets` seems like a boundary call. Being able to see which records (of 1,907 total) are being included under this reason on account of that definition would help you decide.

Agent: I have struggled with this as well
For example, Apollo wanted us to stop predicting certain reasons on records that were determined by an automated/pre-select option, but it wasnt clear from the definitions why that particular reason was applied to the record or which one we should remove to fix it

As I'm going through cases and cleaning them up, I don't want to have to go over the same one twice.

Agent: Hi Tanner Hopkins, there is not a purpose-built way to tag or mark records to indicate that you have gone over them. What I often do is visualize the data in a daily or weekly view (depending on other filters – whatever creates manageable chunks) and then at least I can track my triage or review that way.
That said, you could use the ""Save Feedaback"" button to mark feedback records once you have looked at them. That will give them orange highlighting in the view feedback pane, but you can't filter on saved/not saved.

Agent: Hey Molly!
&gt; Is there a way to pin the AI-generated summary to a dashboard? I’m finding that I want to use the dashboard as an “overview” over a longer period of time, while the slack subscription is more like “the latest”. For now, I’ve added the “top reasons” to the dashboard, but the text version is much nicer to read (imo).
There isn’t a way to pin a summary to a Dashboard today, but this is exactly how we’re thinking about the near future! Super-glad that you’re finding summaries helpful, and would want to add them to Dashboards. We’re actively scoping this out.
&gt; When I try to “and” together two keyword searches I’m seeing results that only come from one term. I’ve anded together “annotation” and “dev mode” as two tracked keywords, but the results in the screenshot dont’ mention “annotations” at all. Am I misunderstanding how to setup the logic here? (BTW this “and” isn’t what I ultimately want, just noticed the funky behaviour)
The summary in the shared screenshot (image attached) and Search seems to talk about both dev-mode and annotations Molly, are you referring to the feedback cited from Discourse in this case?

Agent: &gt; Is there a way to give feedback or train AI summarizing the findings? For example, in this summary,
&gt; a. “They also find the decision to include it in all editor seats or offer it separately for a monthly fee to be unfavorable” is in the “Dissatisfaction with Dev Mode Accessibility” section, but it seems like it would make more sense in the “Concerns about Dev Mode Pricing” or the “Unhappiness with Decision to Charge for Dev Mode” sections (which should also maybe be combined into a single section).
This is very helpful, thank you for sharing Molly! Here’s a <<STRICT_LINK> loom> on another avenue to share feedback on summaries from within the product.
Training the AI based on shared feedback on summaries is not automated today, but we pay close attention to shared points for improvements to the model. Looking forward to your feedback!

Agent: > Just noticed I can drag/drop widgets now!!!! Game-changer!!!!! SO happy about this update!!!!!
Thank you!! Have shared this with the team. :orbit-love: :orbit-love:

User: &gt; are you referring to the feedback cited from Discourse in this case?
Yeah the discourse doesn't seem to mention annotations at all, just dev mode, so trying to understand how it made it through the filter. I was expecting the filter to filter only feedback that matches the filter criteria. Is that not what the filters do?

-Working on creating a more efficient process for their quantitative analysis of customer feedback
-Currently doing this with ChatGPT to categorize the data
-They have their own list of problem categories and want to know how often are these problems being voiced by customers and what are the themes within those
-Various solicited and unsolicited sources of feedback - in-app feedback, quarterly survey (Qualtrics), appstore, we listen to audio feedback after speaking to an agent (Mindful - phone and chat - no transcript)
-Lacking quantitative analysis of Mindful data (some of this data is also in BigQuery), 


What decisions are you trying to make? 
Three key areas - product, platform, and service


Biggest challenge?
-Super manual, not sustainable as we continue to grow

-They definitely seem to want to have control over the taxonomy
-They t ChatGPT that certain comments need to fall under certain categories so that they can somewhat automate some of this analysis
-Estimated 2-3k monthly feedback volume","<p>main source if mindful, also not a high priority at this time</p>",,2024-01-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
