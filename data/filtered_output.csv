3bbb09d2-9d4b-5fdc-a82e-d683a4f99370,"User: Jack Divita Running into some issues with the % charts on the dashboard. Upon being filtered down on the dashboard, the % calculation is still based off the total number of unfiltered records as opposed to the total number of filtered records. The only way I can get it to properly calculate a filtered percentage was after I toggled “Measure as” from % to # to % again.

User: I’ll take this opportunity to also plead my case for one or both of the following:
• adding the count (#) to at least the tooltip when hovering over a bar on a % chart (especially in the dashboard view)
• Adding the ability to toggle between # and % in the ( ⠇) chart menu, similar to “Switch to Table View”
It can be much easier to parse/summarize results when looking at relative %’s (esp when comparing filtered results). However, it can be dangerous because of the law of small numbers, as the sample size for each percentage breakdown is not available at a glance.

Agent: &gt; The only way I can get it to properly calculate a filtered percentage was after I toggled “Measure as” from % to # to % again.
Glad this makes it work, this also validates that this is a bug - raising with eng

&gt; • Adding the ability to toggle between # and % in the ( ⠇) chart menu, similar to “Switch to Table View”

Good usability suggestions, also passing along to our eng team

User: Jack Divita It doesn’t actually make it work. It’s still broken on the dashboard. E.g. I removed a filter and the % didn’t update on the chart which I toggled and updated

User: Jack Divita looks like the reason it didn’t update is because going into the chart, making an update to it, and coming back to the dashboard a couple times resulted in dashboard filters that were applied when clicking through to the individual chart ended up saving at the chart level (as opposed to being treated as an ephemeral filter)

07a7949c-1042-567d-9413-0b5b9def2ad6,"User: hey Matt Miller -- curious what this Id field from enterpret is, it's the only optional available for syncing via census -- is that something that was created when the B&amp;B enterpret account was set up? is it the email address?

Agent: Every record (feedback, user, or account) in Enterpret needs a unique identifier. In this case, we are asking for an id that can tell us whether a row is new or existing. This id can be anything – e.g., if you were using an export of data from Salesforce, you might use ContactId as the identifier for users.

User: sorry not totally following -- the instructions in census for selecting a sync key say that the column and field should have the same unique value -- so I was assuming somewhere in enterpret there is an ID field created for each record that is defined as their email

Agent: You're correct – when the sync ran for the first time and these rows were added to the User table in Enterpret, each one had its Id field populated with the user email

User: might be worth discussing live - it seems that for census to sync a record to enterpret there has to be a match on our source email and enterpret Id, and I'm not familiar with what the enterpret ID is or how it's defined (it obviously matches our source email or no records would sync)

User: sorry I think I get it now -- my first sync was an update or create -- so those emails didn't map to any id's but they were created during the first sync

User: Matt Miller we now have our census sync set to update only, because we only want to send data for customers that have feedback in enterpret, but if a new customer feedback is added, I'm assuming we won't have the enterpret user ID available for syncing via census, does that make sense?

Agent: Emily Nicklas I turned the dashboard into a template, now if you click on the ""+New Dashboard"" button you will see this option. If you create a new dashboard with this template you will have full control and edit access to the charts

Agent: &gt; but this is what I’m seeing that’s messing with the data. Why does it say `Success - Category` and `CLM - Category`?
This is because this is the technical name of the field coming from Zendesk

User: Thank you for the instructions on creating a new dashboard.
Re: the other thing, I’m confused, because the field name isn’t matching what the Quantify is about `CLM - Category` is showing as the field, but the Quantify is about `Clickwrap Category`, how did that happen?
And the data is different from when I pulled the Nov data in December. I know that there are usually a few tickets that get updated, but when I pull the exact same things I pulled last month, with the same exact filters, I get wildly different results.
For example, I pulled `CLM Top 5 Categories` with Case Reason = Technical Issues for Nov 1-30. Last month’s was screenshot #1, when I pull the same today, I get screenshot #2. And if I change the field from `Success - Category` to `CLM - Category`, it’s even more off (screenshot #3).
Happy to set up a call to go over these if we need to.

User: Quick intros<IP>Marshall Kurtz, e-meet Jack Divita. Jack, e-meet Marshall.
Marshall is our head of solutions engineering &amp; has worked a lot of the customer feedback catalogue that lives in Notion.
Jack is our Enterpret CSM; we now have Gong calls in Enterpret so I wanted to make sure that Marshall is aware and has access (already sent him instructions to get access if he doesn't have it yet) since it's such a great tool to understand volumes and themes of the asks we get from our users.
Marshall Kurtz, Jack is a great resource if you have any questions (I'm also happy to help whenever I can) - feel free to ping him directly, in this channel, and/or join our weekly calls on Wednesdays (10:30 PT, 1:30 ET). We also have some trainings already recorded which you can find <<STRICT_LINK>>

Agent: Hey Marshall Kurtz nice to be connected with you!
Like Kayla mentioned, we have integrated all of your Gong calls into Enterpret which means you will be able to analyze common questions and trends seen in the sales calls by stage/customer/type/etc.
I'd love to show you what we have been working on and see how we might be able to help you with some of your day-to-day reporting. Here is an example dashboard highlighting feedback from these sales calls: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Would you be open to meeting for an intro call sometime next week?

Agent: Kayla Eliaza who would be the right person to highlight these trends to?

Agent: Hi Alan Doyle wanted to make sure these trends above were on your radar, and that you can use Enterpret to help root cause and understand who was most impacted by the issue. Attaching a screenshot showing the distribution of users impacted by the Saving issue - is there other information that would be helpful to include in this report?
Additionally - this dashboard shows us that there were 4X as many tickets with the contact reason `User Issues<IP>🟡 Notion Incident` last week as is typically expected - here is an auto generated summary of those tickets. Hope that helps!

2352b883-d3cf-5a91-99a5-df04c25a0880,"User: Hi Jack Divita - We're rolling out a gen-ai support tool (forethought) and wondering if that's on your roadmap of data integrations. The plan is to rely less on routing feature request to discourse and handle them through AI-support chatbot as well as agent supported tickets. So in the future, we'd rely on zendesk and forethought for all of our feature requests received by support. cc: Chaitanya Hari and Marc Cruz who are starting to think about this on the support side.

User: cc Omar Guerrero

Agent: Its on the roadmap, though no timeline planned at this point. We have analyzed conversations handled by Forethought for quite a few of our other customers though
Interestingly, I have seen some inconsistency in the implementations. Do all of your Forethought conversations get sent to Zendesk or only the ones that get handed off to a human agent?

Agent: Additionally, in Figma's case specifically, which of these sets of tickets make their way into Snowflake?

User: only the forethought convos that get handed off to a human get sent to zendesk, interested in getting all forethought conversations into enterpret for analysis though

Agent: We need to figure out how to get that data out of Forethought then. Historically we have analyzed this data through a CSV extract that their reps have shared with us.
I will re-start the convo on our side, do you know if they are offering an API that would allow you to get all of your conversations into your instance of Snowflake?

User: they offer this as an out of the box integration, i'll ask them about what APIs they have available. We don't yet have forethought hooked up to anything

Agent: I suspect that will be the best route for us, given that you are sending us all of your Zendesk tickets through Snowflake and not from Zendesk directly

• Taxonomy update project
 ◦ Last update: Mitch Louie has prepared a preliminary <<STRICT_LINK>> of potential reasons we want to create in Enterpret based on the PFRs in SFDC
 ◦ Next action: Fred Kang to review and confirm the list
 ◦ Following: Jack Divita to help programmatically update Enterpret taxonomy based on this feedback
• Closed lost deal analysis project
 ◦ Last update: first draft of report shared <<STRICT_LINK>>
 ◦ Next action: Jack Divita to fine tune dashboard based on feedback from Fred
 ◦ Following update: Continue to use dashboard to track impact of feature launches on won/loss deal ratios
• Other updates
 ◦ Enterpret chat interface (called `Wisdom` ) should be exiting our closed alpha testing soon and entering a generally available beta by end of month. This chat interface should make the product a lot easier to use for brand new users - combined with our planned taxonomy updates there should be a significant improvement to usability (see attached screenshot for example)
 ◦ The support summary process seems to be running smoothly - Manjit Kaur Toor please let me know if there is anything worth calling out on this front

Agent: Hey Elliya - something like <<STRICT_LINK>> would work [essentially searching by the ID].
For tags, I think [Jack Divita can correct me here], Notion is not on mutable records, i.e., a notion zendesk ticket is only ingested once in Enterpret, normally after a short delay. Some tags are applied after ticket resolution, which is why searching on them wouldn't be reliable.

User: Ah, perfect! Thanks Arnav, that's exactly what I was looking for.

Agent: curious that the contact reason and date didnt work, was that just because it returned too many matches?

User: Nope, the ticket hasn't been closed yet! So either it isn't in enterpret yet, or the tags haven't been applied, or...
Searching by the unique ID returned no results for that unique ID either. Not urgent, I'll check it in a few days.

• *Keywords:* In our current approach, we only do initial keyword tagging from user text, though we will subsequently highlight relevant terms in agent text.

Agent: Almost, all we ""need"" is

• transcript
• date of conversation
Other metadata on who the user is is always useful. But what is typically most useful, is being able to do analysis that shows:
1. These are the tickets that the chatbot is good at solving on its own
2. These are the tickets that the chatbot had to pass along to a human
3. These are the tickets that only went to a human
it is not exactly clear to me how we separate the tickets into these buckets, is it safe to assume all of the tickets in 1) are the ones from the CSV? how do we know which ones are in 2)?

User: thanks! do you happen to know what the last chat date we previously uploaded? i'm also considering just taking feb onward. we turned off the buttons so this data would probably give us better info on what customers are asking
1. we don't have a good way for checking this now. the CSV will include all chats including escalated to a human
2. if the chat escalated to an agent, we'll have a ticket ID that i can add to it. however, a ticket is also created if the customer goes through the feature request, language intent, or the customer indicates at the end the bot resolved their issue. 
 a. there's also a deflect tag but this would also include dropoffs which could account for a majority of the chats

we have through January end, so that makes sense

User: Hi Varun - good to meet you too! Unfortunately, I can't do those times on Friday. Let me know if you have any availability next week!

Agent: Hey Aki Tas - How's next Monday or Tuesday between 12:30 - 3 PM PT?

User: These windows are currently open for me. Aki Tas, are you back to European time now? My mornings those days are also flexible, particularly Monday after 10am PT.

Agent: Dan Reddin, any chance you’ll be in the office at that time? I’m going to be in the Bay area next week 

User: On Monday, yes.

User: Probably on Tuesday as well.

Agent: Great! (assuming those times works for Aki) we can do the intro part in person and part digital (Varun will still be in NYC) 

User: I’m back in Europe, but could make 12.30 PT on Monday work 

Agent: Awesome - Invite sent Aki Tas and Dan Reddin

b651b70c-bd07-5b12-998b-0668a9fdbbee,"User: One final question for today: I tried to share a dashboard with members from my team who haven't been provisioned Enterpret licenses. I even tried to create a link using the ""Share"" button that said it would be available to everyone at my company :eyes: No one was able to access it though. Am I missing something, or do they all need to have licenses?

Agent: &gt; No one was able to access it though. Am I missing something, or do they all need to have licenses?
Anyone at Notion can have access to Enterpret - we do not charge by the license and there is no limit to the number of licenses.
But, they would need a user in order to access the dashboard. Were they getting an error when trying to sign up?

Agent: oh - I forgot we configured SSO to be required to login
Jeremy Bui Kayla Eliaza can you remind me how users get access to Enterpret through SSO?

User: Oh, if they need to be provisioned for Enterpret in our identity provider (we use Okta) and have the ""tile"" in Okta for Enterpret, they'll have to go through IT.

User: yep, that's correct. they just need to submit a request iwth IT and we can approve it

Agent: Elliya Cutler if you could share a description (or screenshot if possible) of the error/page they were running in to when trying to sign up would be helpful? We should be making it more clear on our side the they need to use SSO

Agent: &gt; Will Enterpret continue creating new reasons, ad infinitum?
Yes, we do refreshes every two weeks in order to capture insights from new product releases and trends from your users
&gt; I'm going through and doing the work to merge similar ones, but curious if this will be a Sisyphean task :sweat_smile:
Nooooooo :sweat_smile: think of it more like weeding your garden than pushing your stone
You are correct in that technically the list will continue to grow over time, but I promise you that merging reasons together is incredibly high leverage to improve the quality of your instance. And we are actively investing in better tooling to learn from the types of merges you make, along with better automated deduplication

User: oh boy, I appreciate the reframe but it sure feels like pushing a stone right now :sweat_smile:

Agent: yeah, thats fair
I would be happy to help and/or hear your feedback on what is time consuming about it today - we want to make this process easier

User: 1. The wait time to see the changes reflected in the dashboard isn't great, since I feel like I still ""see"" the clutter while it processes on the backend. It's helpful that they turn grey!
2. The prediction of which reasons to merge is quite good! The search works well and having both the search and the prediction feels quite effective.
3. There are *so many* reasons that have only been applied to 1 ticket, and which have very subtle name differences. E.g. `Help Inviting Members` vs `Help Inviting Members in Notion` vs `Help Inviting Members in Notion Workspace`. Maybe for some products this would be a helpful distinction, but some concept in the model of ""Everything is going to be part of Notion, or part of a Notion workspace. You do not need to differentiate between these concepts"" could go a long way.
4. Sometimes the customers don't use the same words as we would to describe a feature. We get reasons with their wording, and with our wording. I've merged some of these to use our wording, but I have a feeling that more will keep popping up with the customers wording. Would be great to clearly indicate ""these sorts of conversations are actually all about this concept -- label the reasons accordingly."" Our clearest example is for a feature called `allowed email domains`, which lets users automatically join a Notion workspace as members. In tickets, this mostly shows up as complaints about ""I tried to add <mailto:<EMAIL_ADDRESS>|<EMAIL_ADDRESS>> as a guest, but they popped into being a member! How do I fix it?"" and the reason is called something like `Issue with unexpected guest adding behavior`. When I'm reviewing the dashboard, I need to understand that _our product is behaving properly_ and these are not bug reports. I've relabeled for now to be more like `Help understanding allowed email domain feature` since that's a category that will make more sense for our product teams

Agent: Elliya Cutler - thank you so much for this feedback!
Looping in a couple folks from my team to make sure this doesn't go to waste
Vivek Kaushal is our product manager and is designing our next generation of taxonomy (you should start to see some changes in Q2) - Vivek, let's make sure we are taking in to account Elliya's feedback
Ansup Babu is our machine learning lead working on reason deduplication. Ansup - can we run the new deduplication script on Notions data? I suspect it would be able to catch many of these examples provided by Elliya
Arnav Sharma is our CTO - FYI on some current pain points with managing the taxonomy

User: Running a dedupe script would be incredibly helpful! No rush :slightly_smiling_face: Appreciate you listening.

Agent: if we shared a spreadsheet offline sometime next week where you could go through and confirm/deny our automated suggested merges would that work?

User: sure! I was trusting/frustrated enough to just let you merge them :sweat_smile:

Agent: hmm, should we pull in what gong offers vs build our own call summaries?

Agent: Short-term: pull in their brief
Long-term: I don't have strong feelings about this, but not sure I'd give it high priority

Agent: We have sources where we wouldn't get this call brief, and the audio/video integration should work in the similar manner to both. Also, I feel organising it as chapters rather than a brief is better, as one can get the brief by looking at the chapters, and chapters can be become snippets, have their own summaries - which we can tag feedback on. wdyt?

Agreed about adding value for other audio/video sources. I think this could be a nice upgrade, but with Gong still the primary call source customers use, I think we'd need to be convinced that we could deliver something higher in quality and usability than them

Agent: Why does Zachariah Ooi want call brief in Enterpret?

Agent: &gt; Why does Zachariah Ooi want call brief in Enterpret?
Because it's a useful way to catch up on / remember the overall content of the call. Call title can help with that, but if it's a recurring meeting less so

Agent: Mockup (it would probably need a special place on the feedback card)

Agent: another way to think about it - if there is useful data available from the source integration, why wouldnt we want to ingest it?

Agent: What if next feature request is to ingest call outlines, action items etc from Gong?

Agent: then that would imply we have a new persona (sales people) using our product

Agent: For action items, yes, for call outlines - I believe would be helpful for everyone consuming audio/video.

81a6b126-adaf-56da-9cb6-4af07b653f74,"User: Hi team, I used Wisdom to create a <<STRICT_LINK> chart> of all tickets relating to Majestic issues between 1st Nov 2023 and 31st March 2024, then exported the feedback metadata to use in a data analysis outside of Enterpret. This chart is based on the keywords Majestic and Missing Ping. I have since come across some Zendesk ticket IDs such as 532452 and 532436 which have reasons relating to Majestic, but they don't have any keywords attached so they weren't included in the export.
Would it be possible to either get Enterpret to check through any feedback with no keywords and add appropriate ones, or is there an alternative way that I can identify all complaint feedback relating to Majestic to export a list of the ticket IDs?

Agent: Hi Louise Sellars, here's what I think is happening: We tag keywords primarily from the user messages and not from the agent ones. In these examples that you mentioned (<<STRICT_LINK>>, <<STRICT_LINK>>) the entire conversation appears as a transcript within the agent message, and as a result the keyword detection is misfiring. I'm checking with the team to understand why our other inferencing methods (e.g., identifying keywords from reasons/summary) failed here.

User: Hey Kylie Henson - I'm not sure if you've met our Enterpret CSM before, but consider this an informal intro: Kylie, meet Jack Divita. Jack, meet Kylie.
Jack Divita and I were just in our weekly sync and he has some questions about how we're using FT - it sounds like Enterpret has been able to help other teams with FT analysis &amp; trends beyond what is available in their native dashboards.
+Jeremy Bui

Agent: thanks for the intro Kayla Eliaza!
Hi Kylie Henson nice to be connected with you :slightly_smiling_face: The context from Kayla is pretty much exactly right. We have quite a few customers where we are helping them analyze their chatbot conversations with things like:
• What are the most frequent questions users are asking the chatbot?
• What are the types of questions the chatbot is able to resolve on its own?
• What are the types of questions that the chatbot regularly needs human intervention on?
We have a sample of your historical forethought data in Enterpret already, but I am more broadly curious how you are answering the questions above and if you would be open to seeing if/how we might be able to help?

• create the individual quantifies on their own separate time ranges

Looks like the trend of outages increasing significantly continued from two weeks ago into last week as well.
I figured it would be helpful to dig in to some of these trends:
• *Issue With Saving In Notion* is 321% higher than expected _(59 Records)._
 ◦ ~60% impacting users on a free plan
 ◦ 30% on team plan
 ◦ only 30% of Zendesk data has device information available

• *Issue With Adding Images* is 175% higher than expected _(44 Records)._
 ◦ 75% of reports on from users on Browser vs. the electron app
Is this type of breakdown useful? There is a lot of other metadata we can share the distribution on - any top of mind you would want to see?

Agent: Louise Sellars The messages would be from internal users? We would treat them as internal and wouldn't generate predictions from them. But one approach that another customer came up with is to use Zapier:
• Add a custom emoji to Slack, Enterpret logo called :send-to-enterpret:
• Configure a Zap where any time someone reacts to a Slack message with that emoji it gets sent to Enterpret

User: Thanks Matt, what we're aiming to do is analyse the themes of historical messages sent to a Slack channel where requests to the ops team are handled, to identify the key contact reasons. It doesn't sound like it's currently possible for old messages, we'll have a think about a different approach cc Grant Orchard

2bcd495c-91a1-502b-a3ab-07bccc9cb5d3,"User: hi Jack Divita i was wondering if it was possible to measure the sentiment change within a ticket. for example, does a customer start with negative sentiment but has positive sentiment at the end of a ticket

User: Do we ask for CSAT multiple times within a ticket’s lifecycle? I thought we only ask it when the ticket is closed.

User: nope, we only ask for the CSAT 24 hours after the ticket is solved (for email). twitter tickets will receive the CSAT every time the ticket is solved but we can adjust as needed

User: Nice! Is what enterpret calls “sentiment” different from CSAT? I thought they were the same 

User: i was looking at the customer sentiment throughout the entire ticket, not their CSAT survey. the thought behind this one is that we'd be able to find tickets tickets where the support team turned the customer's interaction around

User: Right. So what Enterpret calls “sentiment” is different from CSAT?

User: Jack Divita please correct me on this but Enterpret User Sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticket/interaction. ""Satisfaction Rating"" will be the customer's response to the CSAT survey

Agent: &gt; please correct me on this but Enterpret User Sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticket/interaction. ""Satisfaction Rating"" will be the customer's response to the CSAT survey
This is exactly correct

User: thanks Jack Divita! do you know if it would also be possible to track the sentiment change within an interaction?

Agent: currently not possible, but this is not the first time we have heard this request. Have raised it with the engineering team and there will be exploration on the feasibility in the coming weeks

User: thanks! if this gets added to the roadmap, can you let us know? this could be a useful metric for us

Agent: definitely!
Before being added to the roadmap we will likely have some follow up questions on use cases and specific examples. Any additional details/thoughts you can share on those would also be helpful

User: of course, no problem
• positive -&gt; negative:
 ◦ does this lead to churn?
 ◦ are there policies that are causing this change ?
 ◦ these can also be used to identify coaching opportunities
• negative -&gt; positive: 
 ◦ identify tickets where an agent did an good job. can be used to improve training or feedback for the agents

Agent: &gt; • does this lead to churn?
This one is doable today without analyzing intra-ticket sentiment changes, we just need a little more data from Notion

Agent: Meaning - if you tell me which of your users churned (and when) I can tell you what problems they had before churning and how those compared vs users who have not churned
This is a VERY common use case today

User: In order to tell you which users have churned (and when), we'd probably have to pull subscription changes in from Stripe, which is managed by my team. Jack Divita, do you have any additional information about how/what you'd need from us to get churn data into Enterpret? I can ask my engineers if they have time for it.

Agent: The only thing I _need_ is something to join it agains the feedback record. For Zendesk it looks like we have user email, unique user ID, workspace ID, external user ID. For Gong we have workspace ID, user ID, and Email. For forethought, all I have is a record ID
I would also recommend including other additional metadata that might be useful for analysis: sign up date, churn date, churned ARR, number of seats churned, etc.

Mitch Louie shared with me an extract of closed-lost deals over the last 6 months that I uploaded to Enterpret and we can use to look at common requests (and to compare/contrast vs. deals that were won)
Here is a link to the first iteration of the dashboard to help with this. I added some filters to the charts to try and highlight reasons that (to me) seemed actionable: <<STRICT_LINK>>
A couple of highlights that stood out to me:
• The ability to search through contracts comes up in lost deals twice as often as won deals
• Redlining documents comes up 4X as often in lost deals
• Setting reminders for contracts comes up 8X as often in lost deals
• A clause library comes up 6X as often in lost deals
• OCR on contracts seems is also a common one on lost deals
I am imagining this as an iterative process where we can continue to drill in to some of these reasons to make them more specific and further filter the list so it is as useful for you as possible
I'm excited to help start with this process and keep going from here - let me know your thoughts!

Agent: Hi Sy Dusk, unfortunately this isn't possible at the moment. But this has been requested before so I'll definitely convey your suggestion to the product team.

For Integration Descriptions, you can go to the integrations page and click edit on any integration that you have. You can add descriptions to each integration.

Agent: Brian Hendery sarah barnekow We have updated our Slack summary format to improve the quantification and bring it in line with what is now in the tool. Would love to hear your thoughts on this! And it could be a good time to give this another try to see if it's a useful tool. I set up a general search on complaints for this example. (And Brian, the ""gold nuggets"" language that you didn't like is also gone :sweat_smile:)

Using the same number makes it look like all data is coming from one single record (which I would be less likely to trust - I don't want to weight any one response by that much). It would be great if each unique record could have a unique citation number. So, here it would be [1], [2], [3], [4] etc. because each link is unique. And if one record is referenced multiple times, re-use that citation number. (Is this actually a bug?)

User: Here's the actual copy-pasted report in slack:
*Confusion Over Developer Mode Access Rights*
Users have reported various *Issue With Development Mode Access* _(6 Records)_ , including mistakenly granting access to the wrong user <<STRICT_LINK>]> being unable to give dev mode access to another user <<STRICT_LINK>]> and their developers losing access to the mode <<STRICT_LINK>]>. Some users' access level was not sufficient for the dev mode feature to work <<STRICT_LINK>]>. Even after the issue was resolved, users were unable to regain access to their previous full dev mode <<STRICT_LINK>]>.

Agent: This is very helpful feedback Molly Jane Nicholas, thank you for sharing!

User: I always thought the citation numbers represented counts of records :thinking_face: 

User: That would be a very non-standard usage of the citation format - if they're meant to represent counts I would strongly ask that they not use the standard citation format which pretty much universally means ""specific link to single resource"". Something like (_x records_) (the way it appears at the top) would work for counts.

User: Molly Jane Nicholas is this how ivy league presidents get fired? lol

User: Just coming back to this - it doesn't seem to mean counts: each number links to only one record. If it represents multiple records, it would need to link to each one.

User: Thanks Molly Jane Nicholas! definitely my oversight.

Agent: &gt; each number links to only one record.
That’s correct Molly Jane Nicholas — just adding some more context on the current behaviour — the numbers start from 1 for each claim in a summary. E.g:
&gt; Users appreciate Figma’s user interface [1][2], and visual design [1]. They also appreciate They also appreciate its robust prototyping tools [1][2][3].
For this sample from a summary, 2 specific records are cited where users have praised the user interface, 1 specific record where users have praised the visual design, and 3 specific records where users have appreciated the prototyping tool.
Thank you again for flagging how this can be confusing! Have shared this feedback with the wider team, we’ll work on making this more intuitive. :raised_hands<IP>skin-tone-4:

e09e4fc6-dff7-5dc0-a4f7-cb1aa8d00cba,"User: Hi Michael Nguyen, I've noticed a number of product feedback posts that may not be captured by Enterpret in an automated way, is there a way for me to manually flag social posts in order to feed them into Enterpret?

User: Hi Seth Harris! What types and how many of social posts are you not seeing captured? Can you provide a few examples so Jack Divita and I can investigate? I don't think there is an elegant way to manually trigger posts to be ingested by Enterpret.

Agent: We do have some ways we might be able to go about this. Seth Harris what is the source of these posts?

User: Hey sorry for the slow response, been heads down on the multi edit launch today.

User: A good example is feedback we saw from the recent prototyping bundle launch:
<<STRICT_LINK>> I just want scroll interactions and cursor effects
<<STRICT_LINK>> Is there a reason why only the Pixel 2 model is offered, but not the Pixel 8? I know you can't cover all Android devices. But... if you already ""support"" Pixel. Why not the lastest models? Would be great if there is the same selection for Frames. :slightly_smiling_face:
<<STRICT_LINK>> ""Gonna need some more Android device options, my dude. Let's get some Pixels in there.
Haha, nice work though!""
<<STRICT_LINK>> Still waiting for z-index for components with variants with floating elements inside autolayout
<<STRICT_LINK>> But when you set the height to 0, smart animate does not work for height animations.
<<STRICT_LINK>> Hope once you will add different timelines for different layers to make sequential transition animations
<<STRICT_LINK>> ""What about adding folders to the pages pane? That seems to be more highly requested than these micro improvements :sweat_smile:
What about setting default assets to projects / teams so I don’t have to add them with every new file?""
<<STRICT_LINK>> Aspect-ratio lock for images is next?
<<STRICT_LINK>> Record mode would be nice addition
<<STRICT_LINK>> Really to much good, but when you will add also screen record feature?
<<STRICT_LINK>> Could you please make this exportable as a PNG?? It’s so frustrating working with mock-up frames from the community sometimes
<<STRICT_LINK>> ""any possible way to have the time, signal, wifi, and battery indicators automatically added when previewing on the device?
provides a more true preview""
<<STRICT_LINK>> Amazing! A quick wish from here: If I would be able to pull the preview out of the app window and onto another screen it would be SICK! Then it would not be interfering with my design (yea sure I can open a new Figma window, but that's not the same! :D).

User: I'm on a mission to make sure that this type of in-the-moment feedback isn't lost and that it is captured somewhere it can be surfaced to product.

Agent: it depends
can you share more detail on the changes?

User: We appended new columns to the table we sync over to you all, nothing has been removed (they are more metadata columns)!

Agent: shouldnt be a problem on our end and ideally the data should just start flowing over naturally
The only tricky part would be if you want us to backfill the existing data we have already ingested with the new metadata or to only have it populated moving forward?

User: Backfilling would be great, i backfilled the table on our end so curious how that would work for you all

Agent: its doable, but I will need to get my engineering team involved. let me check back with them to see what might be needed to get this done
When did these changes go into effect? (asking with the real intention of checking to see what columns were added to confirm I am ingesting them)

User: I believe yesterday

Agent: whats a new column I should look for?

User: ticket_contact_reason_tag

Agent: hmmm I am not seeing any data with that present yet. But I think you haven't synced any data to us today yet either - I'll check back after the sync

Agent: Madison Kohls we have not ingested any new data with this additional metadata - because we have not ingested any new data since Feb 27
Checked with my eng team and we are actually getting an authorization error for `CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_TICKETS` could this be related to the change you made?

User: Let me flag this to those who supported my change

User: I can confirm the DBT job has been running successfully and materializing.
```00:03:50 3 of 3 OK created sql incremental model ENTERPRET_SHARED_DATA.public.customer_feedback_tickets_materialized [SUCCESS 721 in 75.89s]```
While not very familiar with enterpret UI, I don't see any error messages there either.
We can loop in DI if needed.

Agent: Is there anything that would have changed with the permissions or authentication in the last 2 days?

Agent: For reference, here is the article for how the integration works on our side
<<STRICT_LINK>>

User: I see, let me check the exposures

User: The table was recreated yesterday for the backfill, so it seems likely that some permission changed somehow

User: Hi <!subteam^S03M4F9LS9M> - I see the environment associated with Enterpret uses the now defunct ETL role. See <<STRICT_LINK>>. Could someone from DI please replace the role in the job if that is in fact the issue and also update the ownership of the tables in question?
*Urgency:* Medium

User: Hi Jack Divita, could you help me understand how I can find out the connection details (user, role, etc) from the UI?

User: Michael Wu do you happen to know how enterpret connection is set up?

User: it doesn’t let me edit the configuration i’m guessing you can only see it on creation?

User: I was expecting at least an enterpret user and a role in Snowflake but I can’t find any

User: on DI side the credentials are created here: <<STRICT_LINK>>
these credentials work on a separate reader account created here: <<STRICT_LINK>>
(and so if we’re to debug query history we’d have to see the query history from within the reader account)

User: ah got it, i’ll try there

Agent: &gt; it doesn’t let me edit the configuration i’m guessing you can only see it on creation?
I believe this is the case as well.
I am looping a couple engineers from our side to help with this as well, ideally we would be able to update the credentials of the existing integrations (perhaps something we can do on our backend as needed :thinking_face: ) because I would want to avoid re-syncing the entire table
cc Ishita Mundhra Vivek Kaushal - can we help Figma correct/debug this

User: I can see the problem being not the auth (I can log in with the same credentials, and I see query history from today). But there’s only `customer_feedback_reviews`, not the other one, and that could be the problem.

Agent: we haven't seen any issues with `customer_feedback_reviews` just `CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_TICKETS`

User: This is fixed now!
The issue is that when a view is recreated, the grant to the reader account is not applied automatically, and there’s no way to automate that (future grants to shares are not allowed). So as long as we don’t manually recreate views, we’ll be good.

User: Note for DS would be to inform DI when a full-refresh is performed for enterpret tables. Thanks Peng Wang.

Agent: amazing - thank you all for your help! I will monitor from our side to see when we see the data flowing again

User: Yazad Khambata can we document this somewhere? So we can simply point data infra oncall to the few commands they need to run.

dbe439c0-9530-5976-8318-3fc06b10bd1b,"Agent: Hey team- please find some feedback from Float. Will add the gong call in the replys:
thanks for your understanding on the call — looking forward to staying in touch.
Here’s some of our team’s verbatims from the trial:
&gt; Here’s my early thoughts + questions on Enterpret as I’m going through:
&gt; • So it pulls and creates summaries from our customer feedback channels based on keywords we specifically tag? Or can it tag automatically based on the nature of customer feedback. e.g. if we’re not tracking “agency” or “billable hours”, it can still search + create a summary based on that? Pretty powerful if so. EDIT: It can, that’s awesome! This feature alone will solidify &amp; finalise my agency positioning work :raised_hands<IP>skin-tone-5:
&gt; • I love that the feedback summary can be created based on feedback from a specific time period. Last 3 months is the perfect preset for what I’m working on.
&gt; • The sentiment analysis is brilliant too - being able to see + filter based on this is very helpful for answering questions about why people did or didn’t switch to Float / how we’re currently serving a particular group.
&gt; • Email subscription is a great win too, as it’ll help centralise insights in a given period in one place; so I can share them internally
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Curious to learn about its analytics and reporting capabilities + how confident do we feel we can trust the data and summaries it provides us. Especially if we’re going to be making key big product x marketing bets from this.
&gt; • Quantify = Sum of MRR x feedback reason = This is gold! Showing the MRR impact/churn from each feedback reason is powerful; enables us to build better features x marketing that serves our best fit customers.
&gt; • Segmentation is a key component here though, would like to see how far we can drill into each reason and split it by market, segment, use case, MRR etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I think it’s better than what we have for sure, based on it’s centralised customer feedback analysis features. Unsure how much it costs, but I imagine it’s a low-to-mid 5-figure ACV product, based on the functionality on show here.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions to ask here to move forward from my perspective:
&gt; • Does it require someone to manually feed the model every week to continue getting good results. e.g. building the taxonomy and merging reasons into perpetuity etc seems like a time-consuming job for a poor soul :sweat_smile:
&gt; • How can we use it to help inform our product x PMM OKRs, like Figma did at company level?
&gt; • For queries that are hyper-specific and new: e.g. time-zones etc, the data &amp; summaries it provides will certainly be more surface-level compared to items around billing, allocations, other core product features
&gt; • Can this be replicated with a CustomGPT from Open AI? Could we feed it all our data and have it spit out what we need?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Other than that, I think it’s very powerful - we just need to set it up right.
&gt; The Summary inevitably end-up me wanting to know more.
&gt; 
&gt; Example:
&gt; • Issue with adding Project Dates
&gt; The summary returned:
&gt; The feedback on Float indicates that users are experiencing difficulties when trying to add start and end dates to their projects.
&gt; • *Confusion Over Adding Project Dates*: Users have reported an *Issue With Adding Project Dates*
&gt; ◦ They are unsure about how to find and set the start and end dates for their projects
&gt; ◦ This confusion is prevalent among users, leading to difficulties in project management.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Which, is fine but of course gives me no context as to why or what they are trying to achieve.
&gt; But, I was also a little surprised to see only *2 FeedBack Records (over 12mth period)* :thinking_face:
&gt; 
&gt; I do like that it pulls in Community Slack records - would this act as a permanent store for this data? (that alone could be worth the cost)
&gt; 
&gt; Over in Quantify:
&gt; I tried filtering on Keywords like ‘Google calendar’ and ‘API’ - all <<STRICT_LINK> saw was a lot of support conversations>, which are not particularly useful to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m still left wondering if our numbers are too small to be meaningful, I’m concerned the ‘Summary’ statements are confidently expressed based on 1 or 2 pieces of feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, not really sure how this ties into a Feature Request system. There’s something appealing to me to know we have requests logged somewhere, ideally with some Product thinking notes jotted down but crucially with some verbatim comments from customers. If this is going to reinterpret the results everytime and pull out maybe that’s a good thing but it’s going to be hard to grasp what a ‘request’ is.
&gt; I’m impressed with the concept of searching for terms and then being able to filter results to get to a data set that you can then dig into. If we are searching on the full range of user feedback from all tools as it looks to be that’s very powerful and a huge timesaver right there.
&gt; 
&gt; My main concerns are:
&gt; • Confidence that we are searching all data sources and not missing anything
&gt; • Confidence that the AI is interpreting feedback as we would. I found that when I put a csv of user feedback through ChatGPT (for rates) and asked it to group the themes and tally them it struggled to do this as well as one of us would. It was likely lacking a lot of context around the terms we use for the app, industry terms and then oftentimes a word means something different in the sentence because resource, planning, calendar.. they can all be applied in very different contexts.
&gt; • LOE to keep it well fed with data and context. Who owns this?
&gt; • How it connects to feature requests.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On the last point, connecting to feature requests, could we import our feature requests list from Linear and then have the AI link any relevant feedback to each request in Enterpret? Then we could pull up a feature request in Enterpret and see all the related user feedback including the customers that have requested it. If we can then dismiss inaccurate links, presumably the model can improve at making good connections?
&gt; 
&gt; Would be pretty cool if that is integrated so person adds a feature request in Linear, Enterpret auto-links all relevant user feedback to the request (in Enterpret), then it’s all their ready when we evaluate the request.
&gt; Looks pretty slick! I was looking for feedback related to Placeholders yesterday and it was very helpful.
&gt; • It’s great you can open Intercom &amp; Gong conversations and have the relevant conversation part immediately available
&gt; • It did seem like we need to do some gardening/add some data sources but I’m very impressed seeing this v1 experience
&gt; • The ability to search and filter by sentiment, customer/company attributes (like MRR), is huuuuuuge :raised_hands:
&gt; • Importing everything seems to create some noise (e.g. I don’t need to see all the feedback about payment declines) but it looks like we can filter that out and create dashboards ourselves
&gt; ◦ It looks like it’s importing Intercom conversation tags which we could use to setup a process with CS to help here

dd7a0d57-5ad4-54e7-91aa-49962da93902,"User: Jack Divita Vivek Kaushal Sending a little inspiration your way… I am testing out using ChatGPT(4) to analyze some old survey data. I uploaded the CSV with the prompt “Provide a summary for the most common things that are keeping people from remote recording today. Include counts when possible.” The response it gave me back was very much the sort of response I was expecting/desiring to get back when testing out the new “Wisdom” experience in Enterpret.

User: Here’s the response:
&gt; The analysis of survey responses regarding what’s currently keeping people from remote recording today reveals a wide variety of reasons, with each unique reason mentioned by only one respondent, indicating a high degree of specificity and diversity in the barriers faced. Here are some insights based on the data:
&gt; • **Unique Reasons**: There are 91 unique reasons mentioned for not recording remotely. Some of these include not having the function yet, procrastination, uncertainty about where to record, not being ready to coordinate with others, needing an easier solution, not having equipment, and just not getting around to creating content of this kind.
&gt; • **Keyword Insights**: By analyzing the frequency of words used in the responses (after removing common stopwords), we find several key themes:
&gt; ◦ **Need (16 mentions)**: A significant number of respondents indicate a need for something, possibly resources, information, or capabilities, that they currently lack.
&gt; ◦ **Time and Preparation (24 mentions combined)**: Words like “yet” (14), “time” (10), “havent” (11), and “no” (8) suggest that issues related to timing, readiness, and availability of resources are common barriers.
&gt; ◦ **Technical and Process Uncertainty (9 mentions of ‘how’)**: The frequency of the word “how” suggests that uncertainty about the process or technical aspects of remote recording is a barrier for some.
&gt; ◦ **Procrastination and Motivation**: The mention of “procrastinating” as a reason, along with the implicit suggestion of delay in words like “yet” and “havent,” points to procrastination or a lack of motivation as factors.
&gt; 
&gt; These insights indicate a complex landscape of barriers to remote recording, including technical challenges, lack of resources, timing and readiness issues, and motivational factors. Each respondent appears to have a unique set of challenges, underscoring the need for tailored solutions to address these barriers.

Agent: Agreed - chat GPT did a better job of understanding the intention of the question revolved around `keeping people from remote recording today` but chatgpt wont give you the citations to see the quotes themselves

Agent: but even having the ciations in this case (i assume) is actually not as useful because we didn't quite understand the question correctly - we anchored on general complaints remote recording instead of focusing on what users said was preventing them from using it

1. From the docs it looks like we can test SSO with enforcing.
2. Am I able to give you the Issuer, client ID, and Client Secret or does it need to be an admin in Enterpret from Figma?
3. I see that you support user deprovisioning via an event hook and just wanted to confirm the OIDC connection supports provisioning of some sort, perhaps jit?

Agent: Hey Landon Howa exciting that we are getting this setup. For reference here are the docs/materials on configuring SSO with Enterpret.
Generic SSO configuration guide: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Okta configuration guide: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Okta user provisioning and deprovisioning guide: <<STRICT_LINK>>

Yes, this is correct
&gt; 1. Am I able to give you the Issuer, client ID, and Client Secret or does it need to be an admin in Enterpret from Figma?
I would recommend an Enterpret Admin at Figma be the one to configure this. Currently your admin is Michael Nguyen, it is also easy for us to give you admin access to configure this yourself if that is better?
Some context on this ^ there isn't much harm in enabling more admin users. This is one of the few things governed by admin permissions today
&gt; 1. I see that you support user deprovisioning via an event hook and just wanted to confirm the OIDC connection supports provisioning of some sort, perhaps jit?
My understanding is that this is supported (on account of our other customers who are currently gating access through SSO), but I am not as familiar with the technical workings. If this is unclear from the documentation I can loop in my eng team, but I think this should work

One thing I would like to note - personally I am not a huge fan of sentiment analysis.

Specifically, on Zendesk we see a big spike in tickets on Feb 1 (see 2nd image), but through Enterpret, it looks like there's not a spike until Feb 7.
What could be driving that difference?
• Is there a 6-day lag in when Enterpret gets the tickets?
• If not, what else could be driving this difference?
• Does this only assess sentiment analysis on first contact, or does each subsequent contact get a sentiment analysis?
Would love your thoughts on this Jack Divita

User: Molly Jane Nicholas do you know if the zendesk tickets are looking at ticket creation date or ticket resolution date?

User: Laura Perea Heath Rogers Do either of you know the answer to the above?

User: Kait Schorr has been looking into the snowflake &gt; Enterpret pipeline and might have a pov.

Agent: This delay wouldnt be coming from our side. That being said, at a glance I suspect the root cause is that you are sending us the close date as the created date

User: I'm looking into this more today, I'll focus on Zendesk differences! This is helpful

User: I'm going to put together a doc of my findings for both sources and hopefully we can find someone to own it long term so we don't have the ambiguity around troubleshooting. Feel free to send me any details or weirdness you're observing.

User: fwiw My hypothesis is the state in which entepret ingest the tickets is different from the state in which zendesk is reporting the ticket dates.

User: The state of the ticket itself? I think I remember someone (maybe you!) Mentioning that. I will investigate that angle as well

User: This is already helpful all! It does seem clear that it's related to the state, and not some weird issue with incorrectly tagging, so I'll communicate that back to the team.

User: Molly Jane Nicholas I don't know... that was one of my questions. Norman Lemke Can you work with Kait Schorr on this?

User: The mode dash should be by creation date Norman Lemke to confirm

User: So if Enterpret is indeed close date it would be nice to switch that to match Jack Divita Michael Nguyen

User: I would also be very interested in seeing ""sentiment on creation date"" and ""sentiment of close date"" to see if there was a change throughout the life cycle of the ticket

Agent: Kait Schorr when looking at the snowflake table there will be two date fields that are required by us for ingestion:
• *ERC_CREATED_AT:* The creation timestamp of the feedback.
• *ERC_ROW_CREATED_AT:* The creation timestamp of the row in the table; helps Enterpret track what data to ingest.
Can you confirm that on your side the *`ERC_CREATED_AT`* is being mapped to the created date of the ticket itself?
Here is the link to the full documentation of our Snowflake integration if that is helpful
<<STRICT_LINK>>

User: Yes, looking now

User: So `ERC_CREATED_AT` is actually using the `UPDATED_AT` date of the ticket

User: Also the Zendesk tickets are also being filtered by the *`FEEDBACK_PROHIBITED_DOMAINS` table*

Agent: Kait Schorr can we correct the dates? We can help run a backfill on our end. Also, is that the only filter on the table? 
Michael Nguyen do we still need the prohibited domains filter?
Would it be possible to connect love sometime this week? I’d want to make sure we are all on the same page and that any updates we make fully solve the problem, so that we are not still working through this a few weeks from now 

User: The filters I've found are these:
user_id is not null
ticket status in (closed, solved, hold)
user_facts domain not in prohibited domains

User: One thing to note is we are in the middle of pulling data for an Exec Review meeting tomorrow so unless it's a quick fix we should hold Michael Nguyen Jack Divita

User: + Madison Kohls Perhaps we can capture this request to change the `ERC_CREATED_AT` to be the date the ticket was created, not the `UPDATED_AT` date in your current doc of proposed changes to the query.

User: Michael Nguyen yup! This seems to be from a model built _downstream_ of the query I am proposing. It seems like regardless we need to change the field from updated_at to created_at in this downstream model.

User: Which query are you proposing changing Madison Kohls?

User: NVM, Norman Lemke sent it to me. We should definitely set up some time to align on this

User: Yes! let me find a time for us, Michael, and Norman so I can give better context :smile:

Let us look into this and get back to you. We have noticed some regression in our inferencing pipeline over the weekend, where records were ingested but the inferencing was stuck due to some issue. This could be related.
Will get this resolved at earliest.

1feedbb3-6a01-5ec1-b9f6-610095536d1f,"Agent: Hi everyone :wave: sharing an end of week recap as there are a lot of exciting things going on between Figma and Enterpret right now!
Ever since we integrated the Zendesk ticket data we have seen a dramatic increase in the interest in Enterpret from all of you Figmates! This week had really great training onboarding sessions with Heath Rogers (and folks from your team), and Madison Kohls as representation from the billing team.
For anyone else who might be interested in getting started with Enterpret I have included two links below that I think will be useful for you all. First is a 10 minute overview video that will cover all of the basics of what you need to know to get started, and second is my calendar link along with an open invitation for anyone at Figma who might want to ask some questions and have more of a guided onboarding:
Link to video overview of Enterpret: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Calendar link to schedule personalized product onboarding: <<STRICT_LINK>>
I also wanted to highlight some ongoing work from our team:
• Molly Jane Nicholas Has created some really amazing dashboards highlighting the feedback on the recent Dev Mode launch. There are also a number of subscriptions directly pushing summarized insights to some team-specific Slack channels - this is *exactly* how we recommend taking advantage of feedback during product launches:
 ◦ Have a home page where everyone can align on the same data + trends
 ◦ Automate pushing insights to Slack so that people can stay up to date on whats going on without having to run their own reports (allowing them to deep dive if they see something interesting)
 ◦ To checkout her dashboard follow this link here:
 ▪︎ <<STRICT_LINK>>
• There are some gaps in the Zendesk data that we are working through. All of the analysis you can do in Enterpret will be correct, but there is a chance it is not fully complete as we are not ingesting every single support ticket. You can follow along with the progress in the thread linked below:
 ◦ <<STRICT_LINK>>
• This week we launched the beta version of our chat interface called `Wisdom` - this will allow you to ask questions and learn from your customer feedback through normal natural language (as opposed to constructing a query through our UI)
 ◦ I have attached an example of what this type of interface looks like
 ◦ If you are interested in participating in the beta product launch please let me know and I will add you
If anyone has any questions or ideas please do not hesitate to reach out - we love to hear from you all!

72617242-b7e6-5d01-bc72-9653fcaaa28f,"Agent: Hey Kayla Eliaza Jeremy Bui great catching up today to talk through our users+accounts modeling available in Enterpret. Summarizing our call below:
tl;dr - you can sync user + account metadata to Enterpret to enable advanced reporting on customer feedback, for example:
• Understanding the revenue impact of different reasons for feedback
• Understanding root causes behind user churn
• Understanding major causes for friction in user onboarding+activation 
The easiest way to set this up is to start syncing this data to us through Census, the documentation for setting this up is included below. You can sync any type of metadata to us as a part of this sync, the most important part is that we have a primary key that we can use to join against your existing feedback data. From Zendesk we are receiving a variety of different ID's along with the user email but it sounds like the best one to use would be the Notion user ID - which we are receiving in two different formats (which I have highlighted in the example below) - these two fields seem to be populated on about 77% of Zendesk tickets we have received in the last 3 months

00882ddb-6441-54d0-8c56-62c2024a53f8,"Agent: Michael Nguyen starting this thread to follow up on something we were chatting about the other day - I think we need a clear definition and owner of the snowflake tables that are currently being ingested into Enterpret.
1. We need clarity on what data is being analyzed, and, even more importantly, what data is not being analyzed
2. We need to know who to go to when we want to make changes to the data model
 a. From my conversation with the support team this week there are new dimensions of metadata that we would want to bring in
Currently there are two snowflake tables that are being brought in to Enterpret:
• `Snowflake CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_TICKETS`
 ◦ Database name: ENTERPRET_SHARED_DATA
 ◦ This is Zendesk data
• `Snowflake CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_REVIEWS` 
 ◦ Database name: ENTERPRET_SHARED_DATA
 ◦ Customer feedback reviews table name: CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_REVIEWS
 ◦ These are Asana feedback tickets (go/voc)
For both sources we are ingesting a value for `erc_id` which, best as I know, represents the unique ID for each record on the Figma side. Based on previous conversations, I know that we are not being sent every single record for each of these sources - but it is not clear what the criteria being used to determine what records are sent to us. Even if we do not change this definition, I think it will be very helpful for everyone involved if we can atleast share this definition
I have included some analysis from my side to help with this investigation, but ultimately we will need someone from the Figma data engineering team to own this. For the Zendesk ERC ID's, they appear to be sequential and make me think that you are sending us roughly 40% of tickets. The asana ticket ID's do not appear to be sequential.
Spreadsheet with extract of ticket ID's: <<STRICT_LINK>>
Who would be the right person to ask about this and to own this moving forward from the Figma team? Is there any other data I can provide from the Enterpret side to help with this?

User: Hey Jack! Thanks for putting this together. I will hop in and help figure this out, or at least hunt down an owner.

Agent: Amazing - thank you so much!
Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help

User: thank you so much Kait Schorr This is gonna be a huge win for us! :pray<IP>skin-tone-3:

User: Looking into the Asana tickets (so `CUSTOMER_FEEDBACK_REVIEWS` and they aren't actually incremental, they are randomly generated unique numbers, so the gaps between the numbers doesn't signify missing tickets. the `erc_id` is indeed the task id number, though, and you can only see it when you're using asana in the browser (it's the last bit of the url)

User: yup but see examples in previous threads where we _are_ missing some tickets and we don't understand why

User: Understood! I'm still digging into it, just wanted to share that finding since the spreadsheet was calculating the jumps between Asana tickets as well. I'm looking at the queries and I will trace them from the source and see where/why things are dropping off

User: For the Asana tickets, anything from the following domains is filtered out according to the query:

User: As well as only tickets generated in this project:
```ID: <CREDIT_CARD>
Name: VoC Needs ```

1. Mitch Louie - pull a list of example reasons using our Salesforce PFRs for `Smart Import` and `Playbooks`. We'll use this to inform what we may need to create, or merge existing reasons, in Enterpret. 
2. Fred Kang - Once we have the list we'll need your help along with the PM who owns playbooks to validate which reasons, and how they're defined, that we want to set up in Enterpret. 
3. Jack Divita - Once 2 is completed, I'll work with you to create the new reasons and merge existing reasons. From there hopefully we can do a quick refresh in Enterpret to see what it is able to pull in a report. The PM Owners can then validate whether the updates were helpful.

 ◦ Now that the taxonomy is fully customizable I recommend we follow a thorough and systematic approach by tackling key areas one by one sequentially. I am happy to help put in work on this front to help guide, but I cannot be the one making the tactical decisions on reason definitions
 ▪︎ I will never know your business and your priorities as well as you all. Who would be best for me to work with on this front? Mitch Louie should this be me and you?
• Nail down core use cases
 ◦ Manjit Toor I want your monthly support summaries to be as automated as possible. Using this template should get you 90% of the way there, do you agree?
 ▪︎ <<STRICT_LINK>>
• Expand to more core use cases
 ◦ Julia Bendix I know there are other executive reports outside of monthly support tickets that you were hoping to be sharing. Can you share some examples of what those might be?
• Expand to decentralized insight production
 ◦ At our other customers we have seen VOC have a lot of success by sponsoring dedicated Enterpret training sessions with product, support, and operations stakeholders (anyone who might have some use for customer feedback in their day to day). We spend 45 minutes together and by the end of it people know how to create their own reports and find their own insights
 ◦ I think we should be aiming to start running sessions like these by late February/early March when we have spent some more time fine tuning the taxonomy
 ▪︎ Julia Bendix How do you feel about that timeline? Any initial thoughts on who some of these teams who might benefit most from using feedback first hand would be?

User: Re: Taxonomy fine tuning - yep that would be me. Fred Kang would you or anyone on your team like to be involved?

User: Mitch Louie yep we can start with me and i can pull people in as necessary

Agent: Is there a time that works well for you two to have a working session next week?
Perhaps sometime Tuesday between 8-11 pacific time?

If so, i think it would be useful to include it in future sync. Also, in order to avoid having to go through this process again and again, are there any other relevant fields we should include at the same time? Right now you are sending us `tier` , `arr` , `churn date` .

Nathan Yoon any thoughts on other dimensions the leadership team might be interested to slice the data by in future analysis?

Nathan Yoon; when you submit the Intake, please provide a comprehensive list of the columns you'd like to be added and to which Enterpret objects.
Some initial clarifying questions (can be answered here or on intake);
• `number of seats used` - is this the total number of seats on the account/team, paid seats on the account/team, number of paid and active users, or something else?
• can you explain what you mean by `type`?
• what level of granularity are you looking at for `geography`? Global region (EMEA, APAC, AMER, etc.), country, something else?

User: Hey Isaac - to clarify - looks like this is a request from Julio. Julio Henriquez can you please submit a ticket per the instructions above^?

Here is the latest update from our side, let me know if its helpful to give the time on the calendar back today
Open Issues:
• Failed to copy summary to clipboard
 ◦ Workaround identified, root problem still not resolved
• Updating incorrectly uploaded feedback records
 ◦ Mike shared the correct doc - this will be corrected next week
• more bars then values in the table 
 ◦ root cause identified, haven't been able to ship a fix yet
• % vs. numbers on charts 
 ◦ in progress
Medium term requests:
• Support for Discord forums
 ◦ I cant make any promises on timeline yet, but we did just have another customer ask for the same thing. It will likely still be months, not weeks, but I am working internally to make the case we should add this to the roadmap. I'll keep you up to date on any progress
Updates:

e2b96436-5271-5f03-a791-e1dd7ae4ec2a,"Agent: _*[Duncan from PropellerAero]*_ Thoughts and Feedback about his use of Enterpret and Taxonomy -
His journey as a Insight Consumer (PM) starts usually at Keywords -> Feedback Records -> Open in Search -> Scroll each feedback record cursorily -> Read through Summary. Post this he checks if the summary is relevant from his tribal knowledge, in many cases it is sparse insights that he is able to derive from this. Like <<STRICT_LINK>> he is sure that Issue with _*Ability To Export Data*_ and _*Need for Ground Control Points Assistance: Users are seeking Help With Ground Control Points 19*_ are not applicable in context of the Keyword here - Google Earth.
All in all he is very happy with the Summaries direction as it is efficient for him to read multiple summaries, and extract meaningful insights from that as opposed to rabbit holing in Quantify land. One nit that he had though was that feedback generally starts from X records, but quotes show a very lesser number of feedback records Y, as part of summary (where Y<<<<X). His expectation was that it'd be aggregate validated. (X/X)
His general user journey is Keywords -> Feedback Records -> Open in Search -> Scroll each feedback record cursorily -> Read through Summary. Post this, he nuances this as part of a Coda doc wherein he adds EG1, EG2, EG3 (examples of Summary quotes, or favorited Feedback records) in a doc and finalizes a breakdown doc, which can then be used by PMs/URs/Designers in his areas to pick up Discovery for. (SS attached)
For Taxonomy -
• Keywords are very useful, but there is a lot of keywords that are redundant or unusable due to being very broad in nature. There is no capability to hierarchically manage these.
• He was pretty gung-ho about Reasons initially, but found them to be too broad in many cases, even if granular reasons are present, they are not top of mind due to the attribution of records towards broader reasons being really up the pecking order.
• He had heard from the team on 'parent-child' relation of keywords and reasons as part of T3, wasn't sold on the idea, but when I took him through the broad idea of customisable nodes, which can have <<STRICT_LINK> to many relationship> , he mentioned he was excited about the direction as this might reduce the noise a lot.
• He would want this relationship to be auto-generated as Admin'ing the Taxonomy(clean-up, merges, creations) is something he hates as a PM and would ideally need AI to fill that gap.
• He commented that currently reasons and keywords operate in a standalone manner, but should be more contextual and mappable (again not by humans, but by AI)
• He also mentioned that each feedback record, shows a lot of incorrect predictions for Categories, even when he starts from a completely different keywords in place and this is misleading and erodes his trust on the tool. (SS attached)
I also updated him on Oracle and he was super excited for this, as , paraphrasing - ""For me to uncover insights by querying in natural language and see just not text, but list of Feedback records, visualizations, summaries in a single chat like interface is the direction which seems the most intuitive to me. Post having the relationships as part of Taxonomy improvements, I'm assuming the models would have a lot more context about Keywords, Reasons and their own relationships""
He'd be happy to provide feedback from Alpha stages, if required.

Agent: This is awesome Saurabh Arora, thanks for sharing! Did we get any insights on who consumes Duncan’s Coda doc and why?
Was the call recorded by any chnce?

Agent: This is consumed downstream by User researchers, Designers for discovery 

Agent: Got it. Curious about why these researches/designers don’t feel the need to visit Enterpret to read feedback about what’s identified // read adjacent feedback.

Agent: There is an additional layer of product sense and investigation required by Duncan, post finalizing the items he hands over to the research teams

• <<STRICT_LINK>>: total number of _records_ that have complaints on them over time (it's broken out by source, so you could do the addition offline or just take the Zendesk figures)

I pulled some of the user and account data from Intercom records that are in Enterpret, and set up a sample User / Account sync to see if it would yield any interesting insights. One thing that I found is that the top Improvement suggestions change quite a bit when weighted by account data, in this example by the number of seats (in other words, potential seat impact of an improvement). `Ability To Assign Tasks To Multiple People` jumps from 3rd to out in front by a wide margin, while the `Ability To Create Custom Fields` drops to the bottom. A number of reasons drop out of the top 10 completely, replaced by new ones. Here are the charts:
• <<STRICT_LINK> By Feedback Count>
• <<STRICT_LINK> By Potential Seat Impact>
If this kind of analysis might be interesting, we can discuss more tomorrow about setting it up via Census, with a proper recurring sync.
A number of our customers have decided to set this up, and many are already getting value out of it. And we have decided to postpone any discussion on this being a paid feature, and are opening up access for free to all customers for the foreseeable future.

&gt; Nor can I find any related way to find out ""how many customers have asked for features related to auth/sessions"". Am I missing something? how would I ask this question to enterpret?
There are a lot of different ways to go about it. I would probably start with something like this and then narrow it down based on what you are looking for

af05b41f-6bde-5f3a-ae46-6568f1943262,"User: `Issue:` Bot doesn't seem to be running or sending info to my channel.
`Context:` I set up a bot to trigger daily at 3am pacific time to the dev-mode-external-feedback channel, but just now I checked and it doesn't look like it triggered. I expected it to either run, or to say ""there's no activity"" (see second screenshot when I had the bot going directly to me).
It's helpful to have the bot confirm there's not enough activity just as a sanity check to confirm it's working. Just now I updated the bot to send at 7am and it's still not taking any action, but I can confirm there are 5 feedback records since yesterday which has definitely been enough to trigger the bot in the past.
I also confirmed the Enterpret bot is correctly added to the channel (see last screenshot).
`Request:` Any suggestions for troubleshooting this?

User: Update on this: I've now redirected all the bots to a new channel, in hopes there's something funky happening with the slack integration that will get resolved by starting fresh. Will keep you updated on if it works when the bots all trigger.

Agent: Hi Tanner Hopkins, there is not an automatic way to only import users who have feedback in Enterpret – the sync just brings in everything from whichever table you choose. If you were to try and limit the import, you would need to do something like the following:
1. Export feedback data from Enterpret and assemble a list of users
2. Filter your source table to include only users with a matching feedback record
3. Set up the data sync from the filtered source table to Enterpret

What I often do is visualize the data in a daily or weekly view (depending on other filters – whatever creates manageable chunks) and then at least I can track my triage or review that way.

Agent: Hey Molly!
&gt; Is there a way to pin the AI-generated summary to a dashboard? I’m finding that I want to use the dashboard as an “overview” over a longer period of time, while the slack subscription is more like “the latest”. For now, I’ve added the “top reasons” to the dashboard, but the text version is much nicer to read (imo).
There isn’t a way to pin a summary to a Dashboard today, but this is exactly how we’re thinking about the near future! Super-glad that you’re finding summaries helpful, and would want to add them to Dashboards. We’re actively scoping this out.
&gt; When I try to “and” together two keyword searches I’m seeing results that only come from one term. I’ve anded together “annotation” and “dev mode” as two tracked keywords, but the results in the screenshot dont’ mention “annotations” at all. Am I misunderstanding how to setup the logic here? (BTW this “and” isn’t what I ultimately want, just noticed the funky behaviour)
The summary in the shared screenshot (image attached) and Search seems to talk about both dev-mode and annotations Molly, are you referring to the feedback cited from Discourse in this case?

Agent: &gt; Is there a way to give feedback or train AI summarizing the findings? For example, in this summary,
&gt; a. “They also find the decision to include it in all editor seats or offer it separately for a monthly fee to be unfavorable” is in the “Dissatisfaction with Dev Mode Accessibility” section, but it seems like it would make more sense in the “Concerns about Dev Mode Pricing” or the “Unhappiness with Decision to Charge for Dev Mode” sections (which should also maybe be combined into a single section).
This is very helpful, thank you for sharing Molly! Here’s a <<STRICT_LINK> loom> on another avenue to share feedback on summaries from within the product.
Training the AI based on shared feedback on summaries is not automated today, but we pay close attention to shared points for improvements to the model. Looking forward to your feedback!

Agent: > Just noticed I can drag/drop widgets now!!!! Game-changer!!!!! SO happy about this update!!!!!
Thank you!! Have shared this with the team. :orbit-love: :orbit-love:

User: &gt; are you referring to the feedback cited from Discourse in this case?
Yeah the discourse doesn't seem to mention annotations at all, just dev mode, so trying to understand how it made it through the filter. I was expecting the filter to filter only feedback that matches the filter criteria. Is that not what the filters do?

Feeld has been on a _journey_ trying to manage the huge volume of feedback records that have come in since the relaunch of their app. Enterpret, with mutable Zendesk tickets that update every 90 minutes, has allowed Feeld to get a realtime view of the biggest problems they face as they come in.
